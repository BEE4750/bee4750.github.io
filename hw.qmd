This page contains information about and a schedule of the homework assignments for the semester.

## General Information

-  While the instructions for each assignment are available through the linked pages for quick and public access, **if you are in the class you must use the link provided in [Ed Discussion](http://us.edstem.org) to accept the assignment**. This will ensure that:
    - You have compatible versions of all relevant packages provided in the environment;
    - You have a GitHub repository that you can use to share your code.
- Submit assignments by 9:00pm Eastern Time on the due date on [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com).
- Submissions must be PDFs. Make sure that you tag the pages corresponding to each question; points will be deducted otherwise.
- To convert the assignment notebook to PDF, you can use VS Code to render the notebook to HTML, and then use your browser to print to PDF. If you have set up LaTeX with VS Code, you can convert directly to a PDF.

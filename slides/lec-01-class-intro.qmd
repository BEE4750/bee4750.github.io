# Course Policies

## Grades

| Assessment | % of Grade |
|:-----------|-----------:|
| Application Exercises | 5% |
| Lab Notebooks | 15% |
| Homework Assignments | 40% |
| Final Project | 40% |

---

### Overall Guidelines

- Collaboration *highly* encouraged, but **all work must reflect your own understanding**
- Submit PDFs on Gradescope
- 10% penalty per day late
- Rubrics will be made available as relevant
- **Always cite external references**
- Curve unlikely (not worth asking about...)

---

### Application Exercises (5%)

- Small exercises intended to briefly practice syntax or gain intuition
- Clone notebooks from GitHub
- Due by the end of the relevant week (**9:00pm on Friday**)
- Graded only on completion
- Two will be dropped.

---

### Labs (15%)

- In-class guided activities
- May need some time after class to complete
- Focus on "how" to apply methods and concepts from class
- **If you can't bring a laptop to these classes, you can work with someone else**
- Can work in groups, but must submit your own notebook
- Due by **9:00 next Thursday (one week) after lab session**.

---

### Homework Assignments (40%)

- Roughly every other week (5-6 in total?)
- Focus on new or extended applications and conceptual questions
- Managed with GitHub Classroom
- Due by **9:00pm** on the due date (usually Thursday)

---

### Final Project (40%)

- Analyze a system of interest
- Go beyond class examples/methods
- Work in groups of 2 -- 3 for BEE 4750, individually for BEE 5750
- Final submission is a PDF of a poster
- Intermediate submissions:
    - Proposal (one page)
    - 2 -- 3 page report on a relevant regulation of interest

---


## Attendance

Not required, but students tend to do better when they're actively engaged in class.

---

## Office Hours

- Time TBD (will send out poll)
- Almost impossible to find a time that works for all (or even most); please feel free to make appointments as needed.
- I *will* require mask-wearing in my office --- it's not a big space!

---

## Accomodations

If you have any access barriers in this class, *please* seek out any helpful accomodations.


---

## Academic Integrity

Hopefully not a concern...

- Collaboration is great and is encouraged! 
- Knowing how to find and use helpful resources is a skill we want to develop. 

. . .

**But**:

- Don't just copy...learn from others and give credit.
- Submit your own original work.

---

## Academic Integrity

Obviously, just copying down answers from Chegg or ChatGPT and passing them off as your own is not ok.
<br><br>
But often lines aren't that simple. Let's quickly consider some scenarios (h/t to [Tony Wong](https://tonyewong.github.io/) for these).

---

### Academic Integrity: Scenario 1

Dan searches the internet for relevant code and copy-pastes it into his Jupyter notebook.  He properly cites the source of the codes.

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out}
**Is this ok?**
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
**Probably Not OK**: 

- What portion of the work is Dan's? How important were the copied (and cited) codes?
- Did Dan understand what he copied?
:::

---

### Academic Integrity: Scenario 2

Matthew and Rhonda work together to figure out how to implement the codes, but each works on their own computer and develops their own software.

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out}
**Is this ok?**
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
**Definitely OK**: 

- Matthew and Rhonda have collaborated to understand how to solve the problem(s), but has written up their own solution, demonstrating their understanding.
:::

---

### Academic Integrity: Scenario 3

Felix and Rachel are working together on a problem involving a derivation. Rachel types it up in LaTeX and sends the code to Felix, who pastes it into his Jupyter notebook.

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out}
**Is this ok?**
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
**Likely Not OK**:

- Did Felix contribute enough to the derivation?
- ***Definitely not OK if Felix doesn't give Rachel credit for her contribution.***

# Class Tools

---

## Communications

Use [Ed Discussion](https://us.edstem.org) for questions and discussions about class, homework assignments, etc.

- Try to use public posts so others can benefit from questions and can weigh in.
- **I will make announcements through Ed**.

<br>

When urgency or privacy is required, email is ok.


---

## Course Website

<https://viveks.me/environmental-systems-analysis>

- Central hub for information, schedule, and policies
- Will add link and some information to Canvas (assignment due dates, etc)

---

## Computing Tools

Systems analysis requires mathematical modeling, and computing allows that to scale.

---

### Julia

In this course, we will use the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org).
<br><br>
All assignments, labs, and AEs will be provided as Jupyter Notebooks.

---

### GitHub Classroom

Homework assignments will be distributed using GitHub Classroom.

- Every student will have a unique "repository."
- When assignment is released, I will share the link for repository creation on Ed Discussion.
- Makes it easy to share code for assistance and debugging.


# Upcoming Schedule

## Next Classes

**Wednesday**: Onboarding/AE to set up Julia and GitHub and get a head start on HW 1.
<br><br>
**Monday**: What is a system? Why do we care?

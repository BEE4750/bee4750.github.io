# Decision Problems

## Wastewater Model Revisited

![Diagram of CRUD release from two factories](images/river_diagram.png)

Consider the wastewater model from [Lecture 5](lecture02-2.qmd).

## Wastewater Model Revisited

Environmental authorities have sampled water from the river and determined that concentrations exceed the legal standard (1 mg/L).

We want to design a CRUD removal plan to get back in compliance.

## Prescriptive Modeling

If we want to design a treatment strategy, we are now in the world of *prescriptive modeling*.

**Recall**: Precriptive modeling is intended to specify an action, policy, or decision.

- Descriptive modeling question: "What happens if I do something?"
- Prescriptive modeling question: "What should I do?"
:::

## Decision Models

To make a decision, we need certain pieces of information which:

- define decision options (or **alternatives**);
- provide one or more **objectives** to assess performance;
- specify **constraints** to tell us what decisions are possible or acceptable.

## Objectives

Typical objectives can include:

- Minimizing costs (or maximizing profits);
- Minimizing environmental impacts;
- Maximizing some other performance metric.

## Constraints

Constraints often come from engineering or societal restrictions.

- Regulatory limits on pollution;
- Supply constraints;
- Budgetary constraints;
- Engineering constraints.

## Decision Model for the Wastewater Model

Let's apply this framework to the CRUD release problem.

- What might our objective be?
- What constraints do we have?


## Formulating an Objective

Let's say that our objective is to minimize costs, and relevant constraints include the regulatory standard.

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

Treating CRUD costs $\$50 E^2 \text{ per } 1000 \ \text{m}^3,$ where $E$ is the treatment efficiency.

:::

## Formulating an Objective

![Diagram of CRUD release from two factories](images/river_diagram.png)

This makes the daily treatment cost
$$C(E_1, E_2) = 50(100)E_1^2 + 50(60)E_2^2 = 5000E_1^2 + 3000E_2^2.$$

## Formulating an Objective

Daily Treatment Cost (the **metric**): 

$$C(E_1, E_2) = 50(100)E_1^2 + 50(60)E_2^2 = 5000E_1^2 + 3000E_2^2.$$

Then if the objective is to minimize the cost, we write:

$$\min_{E_1, E_2} 5000E_1^2 + 3000E_2^2.$$

## Developing Constraints

But we can't choose just any $E_1$ and $E_2$ to minimize the cost, or we would just choose $E_1=E_2=0$.

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
For example, we need to comply with the regulatory standard: 

CRUD concentration $< 1$ mg/l.
:::

## Developing Constraints

**What information can we bring to bear?**

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Recall (from a while ago) our assumption that CRUD decays as it moves downriver.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

Since we know that the concentrations are highest at the points of discharge, we can check whether each of those points is in compliance with the standard.

## Mass Balance at Release 1

![](images/crud-release-1-treated.svg)

Total CRUD after factory 1 release: $\color{blue}\text{100} + \color{red} 1000(1-E_1) \color{black} \ \text{kg/d}$

## Mass Balance at Release 1

- Total CRUD after factory 1 release: $\color{blue}\text{100} + \color{red} 1000(1-E_1) \color{black} \ \text{kg/d}$
- Our standard is $1 \ \text{mg/L} = 10^{-3} \ \text{kg/m}^3$
- The volume of the inflow is $600,000 \ \text{m}^3\text{/d}$.

So the constraint until we hit Release 2 is: 
$$100 + 1000(1-E_1) \leq 600 \Rightarrow \boxed{1000E_1 \geq 500}
$$

## Mass Balance at Release 2

![](images/crud-release-2-treated.svg){fig-align="center"}

We had derived that the CRUD concentration at release 2 is:

$$(1100 - 1000E_1) \exp(-0.18) + 1200(1 - E_2) \ \text{kg/d}.$$

## Constraint at Release 2

The volume at release 2 is $660,000 \ \text{m}^3\text{/d}$, so the constraint is:

$$(1100 - 1000E_1) \exp(-0.18) + 1200(1 - E_2) \leq 660.$$

## Constraint at Release 2

Simplifying:

$$\begin{aligned}
(1100 - 1000E_1) \exp(-0.18) + 1200(1 - E_2) &\leq 660  \\\\
(1100 - 1000E_1) 0.835 + 1200(1 - E_2) &\leq 660  \\\\
2119 - 835E_1 - 1200E_2 &\leq 660
\end{aligned}$$

$$\Rightarrow \boxed{835E_1 + 1200E_2 \geq 1459}$$

## Model Formulation

Combining our objective and our regulatory constraints:

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
& \min_{E_1, E_2} & 5000E_1^2 + 3000E_2^2 \notag \\\\
& \text{subject to:} & 1000 E_1  &\geq 500 \notag \\
& & 35E_1 + 1200E_2  &\geq 1459 \notag
\end{alignat}$$

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

**Is this complete?**
:::

## Model Formulation

$$\begin{alignat}{3}
& \min_{E_1, E_2} &\quad  5000E_1^2 + 3000E_2^2 &  \\\\
& \text{subject to:} & 1000 E_1 &\geq 500 \\
& & 835E_1 + 1200E_2 &\geq 1459 \\
& & \color{purple}E_1, E_2 &\;\color{purple}\geq 0 \\
& & \color{purple}E_1, E_2 &\;\color{purple}\leq 1
\end{alignat}$$

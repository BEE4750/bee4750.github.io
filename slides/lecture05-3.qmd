# Simple Climate Models and Lab 2

## Overview

- Due Friday (**9/22**) at 9pm on Gradescope.
- Notebook is a little long, but exercises *should* be short.
- Remember to "Run All" before exporting and submitting.

## Radiative Forcing

Climate changes result from changes to the energy balance of the planet, due to *e.g.*:

- greenhouse gas emissions (which trap radiation, warming the planet);
- aerosol emissions from air pollution or volcanic eruptions (which block incoming radiation, cooling the planet);
- changes to the solar cycle (which can increase or decrease the incoming solar radiation).

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
These changes to the radiative balance are called **radiative forcings** (RF).

These projections are under RCP 8.5, which is the "worst-case" official future climate scenario.

## Energy Balance Model (EBM)

- Simplest possible climate model.
- Treats the Earth as a 0-dimensional sphere covered with water.
- Earth warms due to imbalance in average (over surface area) heat flux.

## EBM Equations

\begin{align*}
\overbrace{\frac{dH}{dt}}^{\text{change in heat}} &= \overbrace{F}^{\text{RF}} - \overbrace{\lambda T}^{\substack{\text{change in} \\ \text{temperature}}} \\
\underbrace{C}_{\substack{\text{ocean heat} \\ \text{capacity}}} \frac{dT}{dt} &= F - \lambda T
\end{align*}

The proportionality coefficient $\lambda$ is important: it is the **climate feedback factor** and controls how much the Earth warms in response to radiative forcing.

## What the EBM Neglects

The EBM is a one-box model of the Earth's climate: models energy balance between incoming and outgoing heat. As such, it neglects:

- "Deep" ocean heat uptake and cycling.
- Multiple atmospheric layers.
- Spatial patterns of atmospheric and ocean circulation.

## Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS)

Under steady-state conditions (constant $F$ and $dT/dt = 0$), $$T = \frac{F}{\lambda}.$$

When we double atmospheric CO~2~, we refer to the equilibrium temperature $S$ as the **equilibrium climate sensitivity**:

$$S = \underbrace{F_{2\times \text{CO}_2}}_{\approx 4 \text{W/m}^2}/\lambda$$

# Lab 2 Instructions

## Monte Carlo for ECS Uncertainty

Your task in the lab: obtain projections under RCP 8.5 forcing and ECS uncertainty using Monte Carlo

How does uncertainty in the ECS propagate to uncertainty in temperatures in 2100?

# Upcoming Schedule

## Next Classes

**Next Week**: Prescriptive Modeling and Optimization

## Assessments

**Friday**: Homework 2 and Lab 2 both due.

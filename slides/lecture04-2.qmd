# Review and Questions

## Last Class

- Simulation involves running a model to evaluate dynamics.
- Allows us to look at how system behaves under different conditions and/or parameter values.
- Think of analogy to experimentation.
- Looked at example of dissolved oxygen.

# Uncertainty and Systems Analysis

## Systems and Uncertainty

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
Deterministic systems models can be subject to uncertainties due to the separation between the "internals" of the system and the "external" environment.
:::

::: {.column width=50%}
![Conceptual Schematic of a Systems Model](images/system-conceptual.svg)
:::
::::

## Reminder: "All Models Are Wrong, But Some Are Useful"

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
*Every* systems model simplifies or neglects certain aspects of the system!

Even if appropriate, this results in uncertainty about how results translate to the real system.

## What is Uncertainty?

**Glib Answer**: *A lack of certainty!*

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**More Seriously**: Uncertainty refers to an inability to exactly describe current or future values or states.
:::

## Types of Uncertainty

Two (broad) types of uncertainties:

- **Aleatory** uncertainty, or uncertainties resulting from randomness;
- **Epistemic** uncertainty, or uncertainties resulting from lack of knowledge. 


## Probability

We often represent uncertainty using *probabilities*.

What is probability?

## What Is Probability?

{{< include _poll-prompt.qmd >}}

## Two Definitions of Probability

1. Long-run frequency of an event (**frequentist**)
2. Degree of belief that a proposition is true (**Bayesian**)

The frequentist definition concerns what would happen with a large enough number of repeated trials. 

The Bayesian definition concerns the odds that you should bet on an outcome. 

## Probability Distributions

We often represent probability using distributions --- more on this next time.

The choice of distributions can often play a large role in outcomes.

## Neglecting Correlations

For example, an often key concern is whether uncertainties are **correlated**: do certain outcomes tend to occur in combination?

If this is the case, it can bias results to assume independence.

## Correlated Climate Uncertainties

Consider projections of future climate change for a certain emissions trajectory. 

There are several key (uncertain) parameters affecting how:

- carbon is cycled by the Earth system
- CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere results in warming.

## Correlated Climate Uncertainties

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}

- Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity
- Ocean Heat Diffusivity
- Aerosol Cooling Factor
- Carbon Sink Respiration Sensitivity

## Impact of Neglecting Climate Correlations

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=30%}
Neglecting these correlations can change the distribution of hindcasted and projected temperatures.

# Risk

## Systems and Risk

Designing and managing environmental systems is often about **minimizing or managing risk**:

- Maintaining clean air/water;
- Power grid reliabiliy standards;
- Flooding/other hazards;
- Climate change mitigation/adaptation.

## What is Risk?

The [*Society for Risk Analysis* definition](https://www.sra.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SRA-Glossary-FINAL.pdf): 

::: {.quote}

> "risk" involves uncertainty about the effects/implications of an activity with respect to something that humans value (such as health, well-being, wealth, property or the environment), often focusing on negative, undesirable consequences.

:::

## IPCC Definition of Risk

::: {.quote}

> ...the potential for consequences where something of value is at stake and where the outcome is uncertain, recognizing the diversity of values. Risk is often represented as probability of occurrence of hazardous events or trends multiplied by the impacts if these events or trends occur.

::: {.cite}
--- [Oppenheimer et al (2014)](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WGIIAR5-Chap19_FINAL.pdf)
:::

## So What is Risk?

**Important**: "Risk" is not just another words for probability, but:

- Involves uncertainty;
- Undesireable outcomes;
- Effects matter, not just the events themselves.

## Components of Risk

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
Multiple components which contribute to risk:

- Probability of a **hazard**;
- **Exposure** to that hazard;
- **Vulnerability** to outcomes;
- Socioeconomic **responses**.

## Risk Management Example: Well Contamination

Consider the potential contamination of well water. How could we mitigate risk by:

::: {.incremental}
- reducing **hazards**:
- reducing **exposure**:
- reducing **vulnerability**:
- influencing **responses**:
:::

## Systems and Risk Management

Risk management is often a key consideration in systems analysis. For example, consider regulatory standards.

- Often a tradeoff between strictness of a regulation and costs of compliance.
- Systems modeling is a key way to understand 
    - the impacts of changing a regulation
    - the probability of failure to meet standards.

# Key Points

## Key Points

- Uncertainties are a fundamental part of systems modeling and analysis.
- Need to be thoughtful about the choices that were made in modeling and how they impact outcomes.
- Probabilities: more on this next class, but be careful about distributions and correlations!
- Systems analysis also often about understanding/managing risk.

# Upcoming Schedule

## Next Classes

**Friday**: Monte Carlo simulation

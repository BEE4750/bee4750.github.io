# Lake Eutrophication Overview

## What is Eutrophication?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
**Eutrophication**: common environmental problem in which plants and algae feed on excess nutrients and become overabundant.

## Effects of Lake Eutrophication

- **hypoxia** (reduction in oxygen from the decomposition of organic matter), leading to "dead zones";
- **acidification**(from the CO<sub>2</sub> produced by decomposition);
- **reduced sunlight** (from an accumulation of surface algae);
- **clogged water intakes**; and
- **reduction in recreational value and drinking water quality**.

## Lake Eutrophication Causes

Excess N and P can come from: 

- point sources (such as industrial/sewage processes); and/or 
- **non-point sources (such as agricultural runoff)**.

Excess nutrients are stored in sediment and recycled back into the lake, as well as transported by organisms/consumers.

## Non-Point Source Pollution

**Non-Point Source (NPS) Pollution**: Intermittent, distributed waste input to surface or groundwater

## Types of NPS Pollution

- **Excess fertilizers, herbicides, insecticides** (ag runoff)
- **Oil, grease, chemicals** (urban runoff, energy production)
- **Sediment** from constructions sites, crop/forest land, eroding streambanks
- **Salts** from irrigation and acid drainage
- **Bacteria and nutrients** (livestock, pet wastes, septic systems)
- **Atmospheric deposition**

## NPS Pollution Flows

## Management of Eutrophication

It can be difficult to restore to *oligotrophic* state:

- Reduce N and P going forward to reduce pressure;
- Remove and treat sediment/water;
- Biofiltration.

Restoration takes a long time and is not guaranteed (**hysteresis**)!

# Eutrophication Modeling Example

## Watershed As Environmental System

## Information Needs

1. What will happen to the waste in the environment (fate & transport)?
2. What are potential impacts and acceptable levels or critical thresholds?
3. *What are options to manage the waste?*

## Fate & Transport

**Common Approach**: Mass-Balance

$$\frac{\partial\text{Mass}}{\partial t} = \text{Inputs} - \text{Outputs} - \text{Decay}$$

## Fate & Transport

Assuming steady-state and decay is linear w.r.t mass:

$$\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial\text{Mass}}{\partial t} &= \text{Inputs} - \text{Outputs} - \text{Decay} = 0 \\
\frac{\partial(CV)}{\partial t} &= \sum_i P_i - CQ - \alpha CV = 0
\end{align*}$$

## Fate & Transport

$$\begin{gather*}
\sum_i P_i - CQ - \alpha CV = 0 \\
C(Q + \alpha V) = \sum_i P_i \\
C = \frac{\sum_i P_i}{Q + \alpha V} \\
C = \frac{\sum_i \frac{P_i}{V}}{\frac{Q}{V} + \alpha}
\end{gather*}$$

## Fate & Transport

Can split inflows $P_i$ into PS ($PS_i$) and NPS ($NPS_i$):

$$C = \frac{\sum_i \frac{PS_i + NPS_i}{V}}{\frac{Q}{V} + \alpha}$$

## Example



## F&T Model Assumptions

$$C = \frac{\sum_i \frac{P_i}{V}}{\frac{Q}{V} + \alpha}$$

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**What does this model assume?**
:::

## F&T Model Assumptions

- Steady-state ($\partial\text{Mass} / \partial t = 0$)
- 1st order (linear) decay
- Lake is:
  - Well-mixed
  - Constant volume

## Environmental Impacts

**What are potential impacts and acceptable levels or critical thresholds?**

Generally need to limit average P concentrations to $< 0.01-0.02$ mg/L.

## Incorporating Threshold

$$\begin{align*}
C &= \frac{\sum_i \frac{P_i}{V}}{\frac{Q}{V} + \alpha} \leq 0.01 \\
\sum_i \frac{P_i}{V} &\leq 0.01 \left(\frac{Q}{V} + \alpha\right) \\
\sum_i \frac{PS_i}{V} + \sum_i \frac{NPS_i}{V} &\leq 0.01 \left(\frac{Q}{V} + \alpha\right) 
\end{align*}$$

## Prescriptive vs. Descriptive Modeling

What we do next depends on whether we're taking a prescriptive or a descriptive approach.

::: {.incremental}
- **Prescriptive**: How should we treat waste to ensure non-
- **Descriptive**: How will the lake respond to different point and non-point source contributions?
:::

## Response to PS and NPS inputs

## What About Non-Steady State?

$$\sum_i P_i(t) - C(t)Q(t) - \alpha C(t)V = F(t)$$

- More complex, may not be able to solve analytically! 
- Need to use numerical **simulation** methods (next week!)

# Key Takeaways

## Key Takeaways (Systems)

- A **system** is an interconnected set of components.
- Systems are interesting because interconnections can result in unexpected outcomes.
- Key terms:
    - **state**
    - **stocks**
    - **flows**

## Key Takeaways (Systems Definition)

- To define a system, need to specify:
    - components
    - interconnections
    - control volume
    - external inputs
    - outputs of interest

## Key Takeaways (Models)

- Mathematical models allow us to understand how external inputs combine with internal system dynamics to produce outputs.
- Models can be **prescriptive** or **descriptive** depending on goal of analysis.
- For most interesting problems, cannot solve analytically and need to use numerical methods.

## Key Takeaways (Models)

- **Simulation** models: Generate data by evaluating model to represent system dynamics.
- **Optimization** model: Find parameters which maximize/minimize some criterion.

## Key Takeaways (Warning!)

- **All models are at best approximations**: be conscious of what assumptions you've made and how they might change the modeled outcomes (you will be asked to do this on homeworks).

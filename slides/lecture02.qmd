# Application Exercise 1: Getting Started with Julia and GitHub

## Application Exercise Overview

Application exercises are short assignments meant to tie into the week's discussion. 

These might be small coding exercises (for practice) or mini problems (think about a particular system for discussion).

We will not normally work on these in class.

Today is an exception --- focus on getting acquainted with the basic workflow and toolkit.

## Instructions

If you haven't already, go to the [instructions]({{< var course.url >}}/aes/ae01/ae0.qmd).

For this application exercise, the instructions will:

- walk you through installing git, Julia and VS Code;
- creating a GitHub account;
- cloning the repository;
- opening and editing the notebook;
- exporting to PDF for Gradescope.

## Tips

- Do not have to finish this in class, but please make sure to ask questions if you reach any sticking points.
- Must submit PDF by **Friday at 9:00pm**: turnaround is short this week, but there is little work for this one.
- If you have extra time, can get started on [Homework 1]({{< var course.url >}}/hws/hw01/hw01.qmd) (get the GitHub link from [Ed Discussion](https://us.edstem.org)).

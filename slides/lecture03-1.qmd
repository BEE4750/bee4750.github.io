# Lab 1

## Overview

Labs are in-class exercises intended to get practice with coding or analysis workflows.

- Instructions available [on website]({{< var course.url >}}/labs.html)
- Download ahead of time by using link in [Ed Discussion](https://us.edstem.org).
- Will your have own repository --- let's discuss how this works next.
- Don't have to finish these in class, but due by the end of next week (**Friday, 9/1, 9pm**).

## Using GitHub

- **Wednesday**: we saw how to "clone" repositories on GitHub (remote -> local).
- **Today**: how to "commit" and "push" changes (local -> remote)

## Committing Changes

"Committing" is the git term for locking in a particular repository state.

- Once changes are committed, you can restore that version of the files by reverting later changes.
- Commits are associated with *messages* which briefly describe the change(s) that were made.
- Commit meaningful changes often and use informative messages!

## Git and VS Code {.nostretch}

After saving changes to a file, you will see something like this on the left-most (vertical) bar:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
![VS Code Source Control Icon](images/vscode-github.png)
:::

::: {.column width=50%}
This is the "Source Control" icon.
:::
::::

## Committing Changes with VS Code {.nostretch}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=50%}
- Clicking on this icon should show something like this panel. 
- Click the "+" button next to any files you want to commit, add a message, and click "Commit".
:::

::: {.column width=50%}

## Pushing Changes

"Pushing" syncs committed changes from the local repository to the remote repository on GitHub. 

- Once commits are pushed, they can be viewed on the repository by anyone with access.
- Your repositories are all public, so your classmates, the TA, and I can see your code and try to help debug!

## Pushing and VS Code

Once you've made commits, you will see the following on the bottom of your VS Code window:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
The number by {{< fa arrow-down >}} are the number of commits which are present on the remote repository but not the local repository, and the number by {{< fa arrow-up >}} are the number of local commits which have not been synchronized.
:::

::: {.column width=50%}
![VS Code Sync](images/vscode-push.png)

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Click the button and VS Code will "pull" remote changes and "push" local changes.

This lab focuses on:

- Basic programming with Julia;
- Writing and evaluating functions;
- Writing loops;
- Making simple plots.

## Tips

- Do not have to finish this in class, but please make sure to ask questions if you reach any sticking points.
- Must submit PDF by **next Friday (9/1) at 9:00pm**.

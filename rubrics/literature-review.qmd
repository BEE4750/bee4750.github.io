## Rubric

The literature review will be graded on a scape of 0 (Missing) through 5 (Excellent) based on how well you synthesize the papers:

- What are the key question(s) of the studies, and how are they related?
- What were the key findings?
- How appropriate were the methods in addressing the questions, and are the findings well supported by the analysis?
- What are your takeaways from the papers, and what opportunities to expand or improve exist?

Points will be deducted for missing or inconsistent referencing (-2) and failure to follow formatting guidelines (-1).

This lab will be graded on completion. Full (10) points will be given for a submission which is complete and successfully uploaded to Gradescope (including tagged problems).

However, 10% (1 point) will be taken off for each day the proposal is late (starting at the due date/time), and 10% (1 point) will also be deducted if problems are not tagged in Gradescope (additional points may be lost if the TA does not see solutions because of a lag of tags; these points will *not* be subject to a regrade). 

Problems whose solutions are not rendered in the submitted PDFs will be treated as though they were not completed.

title: "About This Website"
---

This website contains course materials for the {{< var course.semester >}} edition of [{{< var course.title >}}]({{< var course.url >}}), taught by [{{< var instructor.name_no_title >}}]({{< var instructor.url >}}) at [{{< var university.name >}}]({{< var university.url >}}).

## Acknowledgements

Much of the material for this course has evolved from its prior iterations, taught by [Doug Haith](https://cals.cornell.edu/douglas-haith) and [C. Lindsay Anderson](https://andersonenergylab-cornell.github.io/).

The layout for this site was also inspired by and draws from [STA 210](https://sta210-s22.github.io/website/) at Duke University and [Andrew Heiss's](https://www.andrewheiss.com/teaching/) course materials at Georgia State.

## Tools and Generation Workflow

This website was built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), which allows me to integrate [Julia](https://julialang.org/) code and output with the web content, pdfs, and slides in an amazingly clean fashion, while simplifying the process of generation. All materials can be generated through a simple workflow from the [[GitHub Repository]]({{< var course.github >}}).

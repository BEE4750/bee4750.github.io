For example, to obtain the output \n\n> the objective function is $4x + 7x$,\n\nyou would enter\n\n> `the objective function is $4x + 7x$`.\n\nYou can enter subscripts and superscripts with `_` and `^`, respectively; to get \n\n> the function is $f(x_i) = x_i^2$,\n\ntype\n\n> the function is `$f(x_i) = x_i^2$`.\n\nIf you want multiple characters to be enclosed in a subscript or superscript, enclose them in braces `{}`:\n\n> $e^{i \\pi} - 1 = 0$\nis produced by\n\n> `$e^{i \\pi} - 1 = 0$`.\n\nTo get special characters like $\\pi$ (or other Greek letters), precede their name (or sometimes a code) with a backslash: `$\\pi$`. There are a number of special characters like this, which you can find in [cheatsheets like this one](https://ctan.math.washington.edu/tex-archive/info/undergradmath/undergradmath.pdf).\n\nBold characters, which you might use to denote vectors, can be rendered using `\\mathbf`:\n\n> $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \\times b_i$\n\n> `$\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \\times b_i$`\n\nFractions can be displayed using `\\frac{}{}`, where the first bracket encloses the numerator and the second the denominator, as in\n\n> $\\frac{1}{2}$\n\n> `$\\frac{1}{2}$`\n\n## Displaying Equations\n\nTo place equations or other mathematics on their own line(s), enclose the entire block in *two* dollar signs `$$`. For example, the prior dot-product definition could be displayed as\n$$\n\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \\times b_i\n$$\nusing\n\n```latex\n$$\n\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \\times b_i\n$$\n```\n\nDisplaying equations on their own line(s) can improve the spacing of symbols like sums (as above) or fractions: compare the inline\n\n> $x < \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nto \n$$\nx < \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\n\nTo display multiple related lines in a single block, there are two environments of note. The first will center all of the equations, and is obtained by enclosing the equations in `\\begin{gather}` and `\\end{gather}`. Each line should be separated with `\\\\`:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gather}\nx_1 + x_2 \\leq 5 \\\\\ny \\leq \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\end{gather}\n$$\n\n```latex\n$$\n\\begin{gather}\nx_1 + x_2 \\leq 5 \\\\\ny \\leq \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\end{gather}\n$$\n```\n\nThe second environment will let you align the equations as you wish instead of automatically centering them, and is used by enclosing the equations with `\\begin{align}` and `\\end{align}`, with an ampersand `&` in front of the characters which will be used on each line to align the equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nx_1 + x_2 &\\leq 5 \\\\\ny &\\leq \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n```latex\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nx_1 + x_2 &\\leq 5 \\\\\ny &\\leq \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\end{align}\n$$\n```\n\n## Sizing Parentheses or Brackets\n\nBy default, parentheses and brackets are sized for simple characters, but will look bad when used to surround fractions or sums, particularly when they are not used in-line:\n$$\nx_n = (\\frac{1}{2})^n.\n$$\nTo make this look better, use `\\left` and `\\right` around the left and right parentheses or brackets:\n$$\nx_n = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n\n$$\n\n```latex\n$$\nx_n = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n.\n$$\n```\n\nThis is totally optional, but helps!\n\n## Using LaTeX in Figures\n\nYou may want to use LaTeX in figures, for example if your $x$-axis should have a title like $x$. To do this, load the `LaTeXStrings` package and precede the relevant LaTeX-formatted string (within in-line dollar signs `$`) with `L`, as in:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nusing Plots\nusing LaTeXStrings\n\nx = -2π:0.01:2π  \nplot(x, exp.(sin.(x)), xlabel=L\"$x$\", ylabel=L\"$e^{\\sin(x)}$\", legend=false)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=3}\n![](latex-notebook_files/figure-html/cell-3-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",

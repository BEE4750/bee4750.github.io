This should be at the start of most Julia scripts.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nimport Pkg\nPkg.activate(@__DIR__)\nPkg.instantiate()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nusing Random\nusing Plots\nusing LaTeXStrings\nusing Distributions\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Problems (Total: 50/60 Points)\n\n\n::: {.cell .markdown}\n\n### Problem 1 (30 points)\n\nA river which flows at 6 km/d is receiving waste discharges from two sources which are 15 km apart. The oxygen reaeration rate is 0.55 day^-1^, and the decay rates of CBOD and NBOD are are 0.35 and 0.25 day^-1^, respectively. The river's saturated dissolved oxygen concentration is 10m g/L.\n\nIf the characteristics of the river inflow and waste discharges are given in @tbl-river, write a Julia model to compute the dissolved oxygen concentration from the first wastewater discharge to an arbitrary distance `d` km downstream. Use your model to compute the maximum dissolved oxygen concentration up to 50km downstream and how far downriver this maximum occurs.\n\n| Parameter | River Inflow | Waste Stream 1 | Waste Stream 2 |\n|:---------:|-------------:|---------------:|---------------:|\n| Inflow | 100,000 m^3^/d | 10,000 m^3^/d | 15,000 m^3^/d |\n| DO Concentration | 7.5 mg/L | 5 mg/L | 5 mg/L |\n| CBOD | 5 mg/L | 50 mg/L | 45 mg/L |\n| NBOD | 5 mg/L | 35 mg/L | 35 mg/L |\n: River inflow and waste stream characteristics for Problem 1. {#tbl-river}\n\n**In this problem**:\n\n* Plot the dissolved oxygen concentration from the first waste stream to 50m downriver. What is the minimum value in mg/L?\n* What is the minimum level of treatment (% removal of organic waste) for waste stream 1 that will ensure that the dissolved oxygen concentration never drops below 4 mg/L, assuming that waste stream 2 remains untreated? How about if only waste stream 2 is treated?\n* Suppose you are responsible for designing a waste treatment plan for discharges into the river, with a regulatory mandate to keep the dissolved oxygen concentration above 4 mg/L. Discuss whether you'd opt to treat waste stream 2 alone or both waste streams equally. What other information might you need to make a conclusion, if any?\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell .markdown}\n### Problem 2 (20 points)\n\nA coastal community has a 3.0m tall levee (relative to present-day mean sea level). From analyzing tide gauge records, you determine that the annual maximum water levels (in m) follow a [Generalized Extreme Value distribution](https://juliastats.org/Distributions.jl/stable/univariate/#Distributions.GeneralizedExtremeValue) with parameters $\\text{GEV}(1.5, 0.2, 0.1)$. The target levee reliability standard is a 1% probability of overtopping (extreme water levels exceeding the levee height).\n\n**In this problem**:\n\n* Use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the present-day reliability of the levee along with a 95% confidence interval for the reliability estimate. Does it comply with the reliability standard?  How many samples did you need to determine that? \n* Over the lifetime of the levee, mean local sea levels are anticipated to rise by $0.3\\mathrm{m}$ with a standard deviation of $0.2\\mathrm{m}$. How does this impact the future reliability of the levee? Discuss how the sea-level uncertainty impacts the uncertainty of your Monte Carlo estimate.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell .markdown}\n### Problem 3 (10 points)\n\n**This problem is only required for students in BEE 5750**.\n\nA factory is planning a third wastewater discharge into the river downstream of the second plant. This discharge would consist of 5 m^3^/day of wastewater with a dissolved oxygen content of 4.5 mg/L and CBOD and NBOD levels of 50 and 45 mg/L, respectively.\n\n**In this problem**:\n\n* Assume that the treatment plan you identified in Problem 1 is still in place for the existing discharges. If the third discharge will not be treated, under the original inflow conditions (7.5 mg/L DO), how far downstream from the second discharge does this third discharge need to be placed to keep the river concentration from dropping below 4 mg/L?\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell .markdown}\n## References\n\nList any external references consulted, including classmates.\n:::\n\n",

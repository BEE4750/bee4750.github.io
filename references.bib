  abstract = "Managing socio-ecological systems is a challenge wrought by
              competing societal objectives, deep uncertainties, and
              potentially irreversible tipping points. A classic, didactic
              example is the shallow lake problem in which a hypothetical town
              situated on a lake must develop pollution control strategies to
              maximize its economic benefits while minimizing the probability
              of the lake crossing a critical phosphorus (P) threshold, above
              which it irreversibly transitions into a eutrophic state. Here,
              we explore the use of direct policy search (DPS) to design robust
              pollution control rules for the town that account for deeply
              uncertain system characteristics and conflicting objectives. The
              closed loop control formulation of DPS improves the quality and
              robustness of key management tradeoffs, while dramatically
              reducing the computational complexity of solving the
              multi-objective pollution control problem relative to open loop
              control strategies. These insights suggest DPS is a promising
              tool for managing socio-ecological systems with deeply uncertain
              tipping points.",

  title    = "Management of Eutrophication for Lakes Subject to Potentially
              Irreversible Change",
  author   = "Carpenter, S R and Ludwig, D and Brock, W A",
  abstract = "We analyzed management policies for ecosystems subject to
              alternate states, thresholds, and irreversible changes. We
              focused on the problem of lake eutrophication by excessive
              phosphorus (P) input. Eutrophic lakes may be classified, with
              respect to their response to reduced P input alone, as reversible
              (recovery is immediate and proportional to the reduction in P
              input), hysteretic (recovery requires extreme reductions in P
              input for a period of time), or irreversible (recovery cannot be
              accomplished by reducing P input alone). A model with one state
              variable and one control variable describes the responses of lake
              trophic state to changes in P input and other management
              interventions. Activities that generate P input to the lake are
              assumed to create profits, while the value of ecosystem services
              provided by the lake declines at high P levels. We then
              calculated P input policies that maximize the discounted net
              benefits from polluting activities and ecosystem services. If
              ``optimality'' is defined as maximizing this discounted
              criterion, then analyses based on deterministic lake dynamics
              usually lead to higher P input rates than analyses that assume
              various kinds of variability (e.g., inputs are affected by
              stochastic factors such as weather, policy is implemented with
              lags, or parameters of the limnological model are uncertain). In
              reality, all of these complications occur. Therefore, if maximum
              economic benefit is the goal of lake management, P input targets
              should be reduced below levels derived from traditional
              deterministic models. This pattern may apply to other situations
              where diffuse pollution causes nonlinear changes in ecosystem
              state, such as the greenhouse effect or acid deposition.",

  author   = "Arns, A and Wahl, T and Haigh, I D and Jensen, J and
              Pattiaratchi, C",
  abstract = "Over the past five decades, several approaches for estimating
              probabilities of extreme still water levels have been developed.
              Currently, different methods are applied not only on
              transnational, but also on national scales, resulting in a
              heterogeneous level of protection. Applying different statistical
              methods can yield significantly different estimates of return
              water levels, but even the use of the same technique can produce
              large discrepancies, because there is subjective parameter choice
              at several steps in the model setup. In this paper, we compare
              probabilities of extreme still water levels estimated using the
              main direct methods (i.e. the block maxima method and the peaks
              over threshold method) considering a wide range of strategies to
              create extreme value dataset and a range of different model
              setups. We primarily use tide gauge records from the German Bight
              but also consider data from sites around the UK and Australia for
              comparison. The focus is on testing the influence of the
              following three main factors, which can affect the estimates of
              extreme value statistics: (1) detrending the original data sets;
              (2) building samples of extreme values from the original data
              sets; and (3) the record lengths of the original data sets. We
              find that using different detrending techniques biases the
              results from extreme value statistics. Hence, we recommend using
              a 1-year moving average of high waters (or hourly records if
              these are available) to correct the original data sets for
              seasonal and long-term sea level changes. Our results highlight
              that the peaks over threshold method yields more reliable and
              more stable (i.e. using short records leads to the same results
              as when using long records) estimates of probabilities of extreme
              still water levels than the block maxima method. In analysing a
              variety of threshold selection methods we find that using the
              99.7th percentile water level leads to the most stable return
              water level estimates along the German Bight. This is also valid
              for the international stations considered. Finally, to provide
              guidance for coastal engineers and operators, we recommend the
              peaks over threshold method and define an objective approach for
              setting up the model. If this is applied routinely around a
              country, it will help overcome the problem of heterogeneous
              levels of protection resulting from different methods and varying
              model setups.",

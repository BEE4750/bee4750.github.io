    "text": "Introduction\n\nJulia\nJulia is an up-and-coming language, originally developed for scientific programming. While learning a new programming language always has its hiccups, the good news is that if you’ve programmed in a high-level language such as Python or MATLAB, most Julia concepts should look familiar.\nIf you have not successfully set up Julia, follow the instructions in Tools Setup and/or ask for help.\nYou can use other editors for this course, but our recommendation is Visual Studio Code with the Julia extension, which will make life a lot simpler! You should have set this up by following the Tools Setup instructions, but if not, do so now and/or ask for help.\n\n\nJupyter Notebooks\nJupyter notebooks integrate text and equations in Markdown with Julia (or Python, or R) code. To do this, Jupyter notebooks consist of two types of “cells”: code cells and Markdown (text) cells.\nClick once on this section of text. A box will appear around this text (and some areas above/below it) - all of that is within this cell.\nMarkdown is a text markup framework for formatting language that makes things look pretty when viewed across different platforms: web browsers, notebooks, and so forth. Text written in Markdown can also include hyperlinks, LaTeX equations, section headers, and images, among other features (most of the course website and the lecture notes were all written in Markdown!). Here is a basic Markdown cheat sheet.\nWhat you are looking at right now is the formatted text after the Markdown is processed. To see the raw Markdown, do one of:\n\npress Enter while that cell is selected, or\ndouble-click on that cell.\n\n\nA couple of the features you will see in this Markdown cell:\n\nThe --- command creates a horizontal line. This is also nice for separating sections.\nBackticks (`...`) can be used to format and highlight code, keystrokes, etc.\nThe # sign is used to create a new section header; two # signs (##) is used to create a new subsection header; ### creates a subsubsection, and so on.\nYou can create a bulleted list by using the asterisk * or a dash - and a space.\nYou can create regular text by just typing as usual.\nYou can create bold-faced text by wrapping it with two asterisks on both sides.\nYou can create italicized text by wrapping it with a single asterisk on both sides.\nTo create a new paragraph, you must include a blank line between the old and new paragraphs.\n\nAt this point you might be wondering how to turn this cell back into the fully formatted Markdown text instead of the raw Markdown you’re probably still looking at. You have a couple of options, depending on your platform, but the most consistent is to type Shift + Enter to execute the cell (this is also how to run code, but more on that later).\nAdditionally, you will frequently need to create new cells in your Jupyter notebooks. How you do this will depend on how you interact with the notebook, but try to figure this out now.\nOne tip is to think carefully about what bits of code should be in the same cell, as you typically only see output from the last command in a cell. For example, compare the following:\n\nx = 5\nsin(x)\n\n-0.9589242746631385\n\n\nwith\n\nx = 5\n\n5\n\n\n\nsin(x)\n\n-0.9589242746631385\n\n\nIn Julia, you can also suppress the output of a command with a semi-colon:\n\nsin(x);\n\nwhich can help if you want to split some code out for clarity or to insert some text prior to it, but don’t want to clutter the notebook with its output.\nFor code cells, to execute the commands within the cell, we also press Shift+Enter.\nFinally, make sure that you evaluate all of the code cells in order before submitting. One bad outcome with notebooks occurs when cells are evaluated out of order, so fixed bugs and edits in previous cells do not get a chance to propagate down. You can do this with the Run All command in whichever interface you’re using to edit your notebook.\n\n\nJulia Basics\nThere are many tutorials and references for Julia, including a basics overview on the class website. Please feel free to reference these as you work through any part of the course.\n\n\nFormatting Math\nIt will often be helpful to include nicely-formatted mathematics in a notebook. Markdown accomodates this using LaTeX syntax. A LaTeX cheatsheet is available on the class website, and many other guides exist online.\nBelow is an example of a formatted equation: \\[x = 5.\\]\n\n\nLooking For Help\nThere is no shame in using Google, or other resources, for help when programming. There are many, many times when you can’t quite get the syntax to work, can’t quite figure out the right package or command to use, or are feeling too lazy or overwhelmed (I’m not judging either of those!) to dig through the documentation. Some good resources include:\n\nStack Overflow is a treasure trove of answers;\nThe official Julia forum and the Julia Subreddit are also very useful.\n\nYou are also highly encouraged to post on Ed Discussion, though getting a response might be less immediate. Just be mindful that to get good answers, you have to help people help you, and make sure to give credit to any resources that were helpful!"

Use the following code as a starting point.\n\nfunction dot_product(x, y)\n    if ... # insert test condition for equal lengths\n        # compute and return dot product\n    else\n        throw(DimensionMismatch(\"length of x not equal to length of y\"))\n    end\nend\n\nHere are some tests to make sure your code works as intended. Tests like these are useful to make sure everything works as intended. One reason to split your code up into functions is that it makes it straightforward to write tests to make sure each piece of your code works, which makes it easier to identify where errors are occuring.\n\ndot_product([1 2 3], [4 5 6])\n\nIf you know the value you should get, you can write a more formal test using the @assert macro, which is a good way to “automate” checking (since you get an obvious error if the code doesn’t work as desired):\n\n@assert dot_product([1 2 3], [4 5 6]) == 32\n\nLet’s also make sure we get an error when the dimensions of the two vectors don’t match:\n\ndot_product([1 2 3], [4 5])\n\n\n\nExercise 2 (3 points)\nThis problem involves implementing Newton’s method for computing square roots; it was shamelessly copied from MIT’s Introduction to Computational Thinking. You will use a while loop instead of the for loop shown above.\nImplement the following algorithm in a function newton_sqrt:\nGiven \\(x &gt; 0\\):\n\nTake a guess \\(a\\).\nDivide \\(x\\) by \\(a\\).\n\nUpdate \\(a\\) as the average of \\(x/a\\) and \\(a\\).\nRepeat until \\(x/a\\) is within a tolerance of \\(\\varepsilon\\) from \\(a\\).\nReturn \\(a \\approx \\sqrt{x}\\).\n\n\n# insert your code here\n\nUse your newton_sqrt function to compute \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) to within a tolerance of \\(\\varepsilon = 0.01\\).\n\n# insert your code here\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Making a Plot (3 points)\nWrite a function to compute the square of an integer x. Evaluate this function for integers between \\(x=-5\\) and \\(x=5\\) and make a plot of the squared values (you can find a quick guide to making various types of plots here). Make sure to label your axes.\n\n# insert your code here"

Refer to “Best Practices for Writing Code Comments”, and remember that bad comments can be just as bad as no comments at all. You do not need to add comments to every line (in fact, this is very bad practice), but you should note the purpose of every “section” of code, and add comments explaining any code sequences that you don’t immediately understand.\n\n\nProblem 4 (16 points)\nCheap Plastic Products, Inc. is operating a plant that produces \\(100 \\text{m}^3\\text{/day}\\) of wastewater that is discharged into Pristine Brook. The wastewater contains \\(1 \\text{kg/m}^3\\) of YUK, a toxic substance. The US Environmental Protection Agency has imposed an effluent standard on the plant prohibiting discharge of more than \\(20 \\text{kg/day}\\) of YUK into Pristine Brook.\nCheap Plastic Products has analyzed two methods for reducing its discharges of YUK. Method 1 is land disposal, which costs \\(X_1^2/20\\) dollars per day, where \\(X_1\\) is the amount of wastewater disposed of on the land (\\(\\text{m}^3\\text{/day}\\)). With this method, 20% of the YUK applied to the land will eventually drain into the stream (i.e., 80% of the YUK is removed by the soil).\nMethod 2 is a chemical treatment procedure which costs $1.50 per \\(\\text{m}^3\\) of wastewater treated. The chemical treatment has an efficiency of \\(e= 1 - 0.005X_2\\), where \\(X_2\\) is the quantity of wastewater (\\(\\text{m}^3\\text{/day}\\)) treated. For example, if \\(X_2 = 50 \\text{m}^3\\text{/day}\\), then \\(e = 1 - 0.005(50) = 0.75\\), so that 75% of the YUK is removed.\nCheap Plastic Products is wondering how to allocate their wastewater between these three disposal and treatment methods (land disposal, and chemical treatment, and land disposal) to meet the effluent standard while keeping costs manageable.\n\n\nProblem 4.1 (3 points)\nThe flow of wastewater through this treatment system is shown in Figure 1. Modify the edge labels (by editing the edge_labels dictionary in the code producing Figure 1) to show how the wastewater allocations result in the final YUK discharge into Pristine Brook. For the edge_label dictionary, the tuple \\((i, j)\\) corresponds to the arrow going from node \\(i\\) to node \\(j\\). The syntax for any entry is (i, j) =&gt; \"label text\", and the label text can include mathematical notation if the string is prefaced with an L, as in L\"x_1\" will produce \\(x_1\\).\n\n\nusing GraphRecipes, Plots\n\nA = [0 1 1 1;\n    0 0 0 1;\n    0 0 0 1;\n    0 0 0 0]\n\nnames = [\"Plant\", \"Land Treatment\", \"Chem Treatment\", \"Pristine Brook\"]\n# modify this dictionary to add labels\nedge_labels = Dict((1, 2) =&gt; \"\", (1,3) =&gt; \"\", (1, 4) =&gt; \"\",(2, 4) =&gt; \"\",(3, 4) =&gt; \"\")\nshapes=[:hexagon, :rect, :rect, :hexagon]\nxpos = [0, -1.5, -0.25, 1]\nypos = [1, 0, 0, -1]\n\ngraphplot(A, names=names,edgelabel=edge_labels, markersize=0.15, markershapes=shapes, markercolor=:white, x=xpos, y=ypos)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: System diagram of the wastewater treatment options in Problem 4.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 4.2 (4 points)\nFormulate a mathematical model for the treatment cost and the amount of YUK that will be discharged into Pristine Brook based on the wastewater allocations. This is best done with some equations and supporting text explaining the derivation. Make sure you include, as additional equations in the model, any needed constraints on relevant values. You can find some basics on writing mathematical equations using the LaTeX typesetting syntax here, and a cheatsheet with LaTeX commands can be found on the course website’s Resources page.\n\n\nProblem 4.3 (4 points)\nImplement this systems model as a Julia function which computes the resulting YUK concentration and cost for a particular treatment plan. You can return multiple values from a function with a tuple, as in:\n\n\nfunction multiple_return_values(x, y)\n    return (x+y, x*y)\nend\n\na, b = multiple_return_values(2, 5)\n@show a;\n@show b;\n\na = 7\nb = 10\n\n\nMake sure you comment your code appropriately to make it clear what is going on and why.\n\nProblem 4.4 (5 points)\nUse your function to experiment with some different combinations of wastewater discharge and treatment. Can you find one that satisfies the YUK effluent standard? What was the cost? You don’t have to find an “optimal” solution to this problem, but what do you think would be needed to find a better solution?"

The oxygen reaeration rate is 0.55 day-1, and the decay rates of CBOD and NBOD are are 0.55 and 0.25 day-1, respectively.

Discuss whether you’d opt to treat waste stream 2 alone or both waste streams equally. What other information might you need to make a conclusion, if any?\n\n\nProblem 2 (40 points)\n\n\nProblem 2.1 (15 points)\nSuppose now that the CBOD and NBOD values of the river inflow are uncertain. Suppose that your estimates of CBOD vary uniformly between 4 mg/L and 7 mg/L, and NBOD estimates vary uniformly between 3 mg/L and 8 mg/L.\nIf you assume these values are independent, what is the probability that the strategy you selected in Problem 1.5 will fail to keep the dissolved oxygen concentration above 4 mg/L? How did you decide how many samples to use to determine this probability?\n\n\nProblem 2.2 (15 points)\nNow suppose that CBOD and NBOD values are correlated: specifically, they have a correlation coefficient of 0.7. How does that impact the probability of maintaining a dissolved oxygen concentration above 4 mg/L under the treatment strategy you selected in Problem 1.5? How did you decide how many samples to use to determine this probability?\nYou can use the sample_correlated_uniform() function defined below to produce correlated uniform samples.\n\n\n# This function samples n correlated variates distributed over \n# Uniform(a[1], a[2]) and Uniform(b[1], b[2]) with correlation coefficient\n# corr_coef.

Does the impact of the correlation between the CBOD and NBOD inputs in Problem 2.2 make sense to you? Would you stick with the same strategy as Problem 1.5? What other information might you need to make this assessment, if any?"

Since turb_coef is a DataFrame, you can access elements with syntax like turb_coef[1, :c] (to access the first element of a column named c).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPass Data To Functions When Possible\n\n\n\nRemember to pass turb_coef to gaussian_plums as an argument — this is generally good Julia (and broader programming) style and improves performance.\n\n\n\nProblem 1.2 (10 points)\nAssume the wind is blowing at 5 m/s.

A solution is to use a comprehension. For example, to apply a function f over all combinations of two vectors x and y,\n[f(i, j) for i in x for j in y]\nwill return a 2d array of outputs of f.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 2.2 (10 points)\nMake the same plot for each stability class.\n\n\nProblem 2.3 (10 points)\nFor the neutral stability class, make the same plot for the following wind speeds: 5m/s, 10m/s, 15m/s, 20m/s.\n\n\nProblem 2.4 (5 points)\nCompare your results from Problems 2.2 and 2.3, What can you conclude about the impact of atmospheric stability vs. wind speed for pollutant dispersion?\n\n\nProblem 3 (25 points)\nSuppose we have two sources, with the following characteristics (distance relative to a ground-level receptor):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmissions rate (kg/s)\nHeight (m)\nInitial Plume Rise (m)\nUpwind Distance (km)\nCrosswind Distance (km)\n\n\n\n\n1.2\n75\n10\n1.5\n2\n\n\n1\n60\n15\n0.75\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 3.1 (15 points)\nIf the wind blows at 10 m/s, what is the worst possible concentration of SO2 at the receptor?

    "text": "The Shallow Lake Problem\n\nOverview\nEutrophication is a common environmental problem in which plants and algae feed on excess nutrients and become overabundant. The large mass of plants and algae have several noxious effects on the ecosystem, including:\n\nhypoxia (reduction in oxygen from the decomposition of organic matter), leading to “dead zones”;\nacidification (from the CO2 produced by decomposition);\nreduced sunlight (from an accumulation of surface algae);\nclogged water intakes; and\nreduction in recreational value and drinking water quality.\n\nIn lakes, eutrophication is often caused by excess input of nutrients (particularly phosphorous, P), which can come from point sources (such as industrial processes) and/or non-point sources (such as agricultural runoff). As the P releases are related to economic activity, we can view this (simplified) lake management problem from the perspective of a tradeoff between economic benefits and the health of the lake: while there are benefits to the activities which lead to P releases, there are recreational, aesthetic, and ecological benefits to maintaining the lake in a non-eutrophic (or oligotrophic) state.\n\n\nModel Formulation\nSuppose we have a town which emits phosphorous into a lake as a by-product of economic activity. The level of P in the lake at a given time \\(t\\) is given by \\(X_t\\) (for the purposes of this problem, we will just treat all values as dimensionless).\nThe level of controllable P release in year \\(t\\) is \\(a_t\\). The lake also receives random levels of phosphorous from non-point source runoff, which we denote by \\(y_t\\). We model these random runoffs using a lognormal distribution \\(LogNormal(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), which ensures that the runoffs cannot be negative.\nThere is also some nutrient cycling in the lake which naturally reduces phosphorous concentrations. This cycling is the result of accumulation in the sediment and turnover (water motion disturbing the sediment and carrying the nutrients upwards) and consumers, such as mussels. This cycling is dependent on the state \\(X_t\\), \\(\\frac{X_t^q}{1 + X_t^q}\\). The lake also loses some of its P each time period of its due to outflows and consumption, which we assume is linearly proportional to the state, \\(bX_t\\).\n\n\n\nShallow Lake Problem Diagram\n\n\nAs a result, the lake dynamics are given by:\n\\[X_{t+1} = X_t + a_t + y_t + \\frac{X_t^q}{1 + X_t^q} - bX_t, \\quad y_t \\sim LogNormal(\\mu, \\sigma^2),\\]\nwhere parameter interpretation is given in the table below.\n\nLake problem parameters\n\n\nParameter\nDefinition\nUnits\n\n\n\n\n\\(X_t\\)\nP concentration in lake\ndimensionless\n\n\n\\(a_t\\)\npoint source P input\ndimensionless\n\n\n\\(y_t\\)\nnon-point source P input\ndimensionless\n\n\n\\(q\\)\nP recycling rate\ndimensionless\n\n\n\\(b\\)\nrate at which P is lost\ndimensionless"

The black line is the P recycling level (for $q=2.5), which adds P back into the lake, and the dashed lines correspond to differerent rates of P outflow (based on the linear parameter \\(b\\)). The lake P level is in equilibrium when the recycling rate equals the outflows. When the outflow is greater than the recycling flux, the lake’s P level decreases, and when the recycling flux is greater than the outflow, the P level naturally increases. The red lines show the direction of this net flux.\n\n\n\nBased on Figure 1, we can see that there are typically three equilibria: a stable equilibrium at \\(X=0\\), an unstable, oligotrophic equilibrium \\(X_o\\), and a stable, eutrophic equilibrium \\(X_e\\). When \\(X_t &lt; X_o\\), the lake tends towards a zero P level without external inputs, while when \\(X_t &gt; X_o\\), the lake will inevitably undergo eutrophication, as the P level will tend towards \\(X_e\\). This means that \\(X_t=X_o\\) corresponds to a tipping point: beyond that level, the lake will abruptly switch to a eutrophic state from which it cannot recover.\nThis lake is subject to a bifurcation depending on the values of \\(b\\) and \\(q\\). To see this, let’s fix \\(q=2.5\\), as in Figure 1. For \\(b=0.4\\), there are the two equilibria mentioned previously. However, when \\(b=0.2\\), there is only the unstable equilibrium \\(X=X_o\\) in addition to \\(X=0\\). For \\(b=0.6\\), the only equilibrium is \\(X=0\\), so any positive P input would result in eutrophication. This highlights the delicacy of systems which exhibit bifurcations: whether an equilibrium is stable or unstable, or even exists, can depend on a characteristic of the system which is often highly uncertain.\n\n\nCode\neq = [0, 0.67, 2.2]\nscatter!(p1, eq, (y -&gt; lake_P_cycling(y, 2.5)).(eq), label=\"Equilibria\", markersize=10, markercolor=:red)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Lake eutrophication dynamics based on the shallow lake modelwithout additional inputs.

Economic dispatch is typically formulated as a linear programming problem, and we will use JuMP to formulate and solve it for a simple portfolio of generators over: * a single period * multiple periods with ramping constraints."

The concept of the marginal generator is important, as the marginal generation unit sets the price of electricity.\n\n\nMerit Order and the Dispatch Stack\nThis procedure of starting with the lowest-cost generation and adding generation sequentially from generators in order of cost is the concept of merit order: plants are scheduled to supply additional electricity based (mostly) on their variable costs.

though hydro is effectively zero-cost, we reduce dispatched hydropower in hour 4 because coal is at its minimum generating capacity and nuclear can’t be ramped down further. These constraints complicate the simple merit order that we previously saw.\nThese constraints also play a major role in systems with high levels of renewable penetration. For example, the so-called California “duck curve” is created by the challenges of ramping generation between the early afternoon, when solar generation is at its maximum, and in the evening, when solar generation is decreasing and demand increases rapidly.\n\n\n\nCalifornia Duck Curve"

And the following commands are all you will need for this course (you can also use GitHub Desktop or use the GitHub functionality in VS Code, which we will discuss in class):\n\ngit clone &lt;github-repository-url&gt;: This is needed to “clone” your assignment repository (initialize your local repository).\ngit commit -m &lt;message&gt;: This is used to “lock in” changes that you’ve made to your files. You should make commits frequently as you make changes so you can revert to prior versions if something goes wrong (and make your messages meaningful so you know what changes you’ve made!)\ngit push: This syncs any committed changes to the remote GitHub repository.

Links to accept the assignments and create your repository will be posted on Ed Discussion as they are released, and posts with the links for active assignments will be pinned. The class schedule will link to a page which has a preview of the assignment, but links are not provided from this page to accept the assignment.\nFor the first assignment you accept, you will need to link your GitHub account to your entry in the class roster. You will not need to do this again for the rest of the semester.\n\n\nWhat if there’s an error in the assignment repository?\nThat’s certainly possible! If you believe I’ve made a mistake in writing the assignment, please document it in the Ed Discussion forum. I’ll describe steps for how to fix your files (unfortunately, I can’t do this remotely and push it to everyone’s repositories).\n\n\nHelp! My code isn’t working.\nHere are some steps I would follow:\n\nSearch for the error message you’re seeing. Often, you can find posts in the r/Julia subreddit, the official Julia forum, or Stack Overflow for the same or similar issues. You should do this first: if you can find the answer this way, it will be faster than other options, and if you can rule out some approaches that you’ve already tried, it will make the following steps go more smoothly.\nPost on Ed Discussion. For the most effective help, follow the following guidelines (adapted from Stack Overflow’s “How Do I Ask A Good Question?”):\n\nMake your post subject specific and descriptive. “Problem with HW 1 Problem 3” makes it hard for other members of the class community to know if they’re having a similar issue or if they can help. Since the TA and I may not be checking Ed religiously, you’ll get faster responses if other students feel prepared to help.\nIntroduce the problem. What have you tried? What error message are you getting? Have you been able to identify a specific line of code or section of code that’s causing the problem?\nProvide code. It’s very difficult to get a sense of what might be going wrong if you just say that you have a problem, even if you share the error message. If you have a small question (you can demonstrate the error with a brief snippet of code), you can directly put this into your Ed post, but otherwise, please provide a link to your GitHub repository and where to find the relevant codes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Update Your Repository!\nYou must commit and push your current files to GitHub prior to asking for help, or we won’t be able to see the code that you’re having trouble with.\n\n\n\nCome to office hours. If you can identify the problem, but we’re having trouble solving it via Ed or more urgency is required, please come to office hours and we can try to work through the issue. This is most helpful if you’ve already done some problem-solving on your own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Give Yourself Time To Problem-Solve\nWaiting until the last day or two to start an assignment can cause problems if you don't have time to work through the following steps. If office hours are busy and you haven't gone through the prior steps, you may be prioritized below than students who are have, and we may not have time to solve your problem. **Running into coding challenges is not a valid reason to get an extension on an assignment!**\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I get a PDF of my notebook for submission?\nThere are two main options, depending on what you’ve already got set up on your computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun Notebook Cells Before Submission\n\n\n\nRemember to “Run All” cells prior to conversion and submission, or else we won’t see your results!\n\n\n\nIf you have a Python installation, you can use a tool called nbconvert to convert to a PDF (if you also have LaTeX installed) or HTML (and then you can use your browser to print to a PDF).\nIf you don’t have a Python installation, within VS Code, you can use IJulia.jl (which will be included in the environments provided with assignments in this class) as follows (enter these commands into the REPL) to open your notebook in your browser:\nusing IJulia\nnotebook()\nThis should open a Jupyter notebook interface in your browser. Navigate to and open the notebook, and once it has completed running, go to File -&gt; Print Preview in the browser menu and Print to PDF.\n\n\n\nHow do I submit my PDF to Gradescope?\nThe instructions for submitting your assignment to Gradescope can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTag Pages\n\n\n\nMake sure that you mark/tag the pages corresponding to each question! Otherwise, we will deduct 10%. If a problem spans multiple pages, tag them all; if a page includes multiple problems, tag it several times."

    "section": "Data Types",
    "text": "Data Types\nEach datum (importantly, not the variable which is bound to it) has a data type. Julia types are similar to C types, in that they require not only the type of data (Int, Float, String, etc), but also the precision (which is related to the amount of memory allocated to the variable). Issues with precision won’t be a big deal in this class, though they matter when you’re concerned about performance vs. decimal accuracy of code.\nYou can identify the type of a variable or expression with the typeof() function.\n\ntypeof(\"This is a string.\")\n\nString\n\n\n\ntypeof(x)\n\nInt64\n\n\n\nNumeric types\nA key distinction is between an integer type (or Int) and a floating-point number type (or float). Integers only hold whole numbers, while floating-point numbers correspond to numbers with fractional (or decimal) parts. For example, 9 is an integer, while 9.25 is a floating point number. The difference between the two has to do with the way the number is stored in memory. 9, an integer, is handled differently in memory than 9.0, which is a floating-point number, even though they’re mathematically the same value.\n\ntypeof(9)\n\nInt64\n\n\n\ntypeof(9.25)\n\nFloat64\n\n\nSometimes certain function specifications will require you to use a Float variable instead of an Int.

    "section": "Functions",
    "text": "Functions\nA function is an object which accepts a tuple of arguments and maps them to a return value. In Julia, functions are defined using the following syntax.\n\nfunction my_actual_function(x, y)\n    return x + y\nend\nmy_actual_function(3, 5)\n\n8\n\n\nFunctions in Julia do not require explicit use of a return statement. They will return the last expression evaluated in their definition. However, it’s good style to explicitly return function outputs. This improves readability and debugging, especially when functions can return multiple expressions based on logical control flows (if-then-else blocks).\nFunctions in Julia are objects, and can be treated like other objects. They can be assigned to new variables or passed as arguments to other functions.\n\ng = my_actual_function\ng(3, 5)\n\n8\n\n\n\nfunction function_of_functions(f, x, y)\n    return f(x, y)\nend\nfunction_of_functions(g, 3, 5)\n\n8\n\n\n\nShort and Anonymous Functions\nIn addition to the long form of the function definition shown above, simple functions can be specified in more compact forms when helpful.\nThis is the short form:\n\nh₁(x) = x^2 # make the subscript using \\_1 + &lt;TAB&gt;\nh₁(4)\n\n16\n\n\nThis is the anonymous form:\n\nx-&gt;sin(x)\n(x-&gt;sin(x))(π/4)\n\n0.7071067811865475\n\n\n\n\nMutating Functions\nThe convention in Julia is that functions should not modify (or mutate) their input data. The reason for this is to ensure that the data is preserved. Mutating functions are mainly appropriate for applications where performance needs to be optimized, and making a copy of the input data would be too memory-intensive.\nIf you do write a mutating function in Julia, the convention is to add a ! to its name, like my_mutating_function!(x).\n\n\nOptional arguments\nThere are two extremes with regard to function parameters which do not always need to be changed. The first is to hard-code them into the function body, which has a clear downside: when you do want to change them, the function needs to be edited directly. The other extreme is to treat them as regular arguments, passing them every time the function is called. This has the downside of potentially creating bloated function calls, particularly when there is a standard default value that makes sense for most function evaluations.\nMost modern languages, including Julia, allow an alternate solution, which is to make these arguments optional. This involves setting a default value, which is used unless the argument is explicitly defined in a function call.\n\nfunction setting_optional_arguments(x, y, c=0.5)\n    return c * (x + y)\nend\n\nsetting_optional_arguments (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nIf we want to stick with the fixed value \\(c=0.5\\), all we have to do is call setting_optional_arguments with the x and y arguments.\n\nsetting_optional_arguments(3, 5)\n\n4.0\n\n\nOtherwise, we can pass a new value for c.\n\nsetting_optional_arguments(3, 5, 2)\n\n16\n\n\n\n\nPassing data structures as arguments\nInstead of passing variables individually, it may make sense to pass a data structure, such as an array or a tuple, and then unpacking within the function definition. This is straightforward in long form: access the appropriate elements using their index.\nIn short or anonymous form, there is a trick which allows the use of readable variables within the function definition.\n\nh₂((x,y)) = x*y # enclose the input arguments in parentheses to tell Julia to expect and unpack a tuple\n\nh₂ (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\nh₂((2, 3)) # this works perfectly, as we passed in a tuple\n\n6\n\n\n\nh₂(2, 3) # this gives an error, as h₂ expects a single tuple, not two different numeric values\n\nLoadError: MethodError: no method matching h₂(::Int64, ::Int64)\n\n\u001b[0mClosest candidates are:\n\u001b[0m  h₂(::Any)\n\u001b[0m\u001b[90m   @\u001b[39m \u001b[32mMain\u001b[39m \u001b[90m\u001b[4mIn[50]:1\u001b[24m\u001b[39m\n\n\n\nh₂([3, 10]) # this also works with arrays instead of tuples\n\n30\n\n\n\n\nVectorized operations\nJulia uses dot syntax to vectorize an operation and apply it element-wise across an array.\nFor example, to calculate the square root of 3:\n\nsqrt(3)\n\n1.7320508075688772\n\n\nTo calculate the square roots of every integer between 1 and 5:\n\nsqrt.([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\n5-element Vector{Float64}:\n 1.0\n 1.4142135623730951\n 1.7320508075688772\n 2.0\n 2.23606797749979\n\n\nThe same dot syntax is used for arithmetic operations over arrays, since these operations are really functions.\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4] .* 2\n\n4-element Vector{Int64}:\n 2\n 4\n 6\n 8\n\n\nVectorization can be faster and is more concise to write and read than applying the same function to multiple variables or objects explicitly, so take advantage!\n\n\nReturning multiple values\nYou can return multiple values by separating them with a comma. This implicitly causes the function to return a tuple of values.\n\nfunction return_multiple_values(x, y)\n    return x + y, x * y\nend\nreturn_multiple_values(3, 5)\n\n(8, 15)\n\n\nThese values can be unpacked into multiple variables.\n\nn, ν = return_multiple_values(3, 5)\nn\n\n8\n\n\n\nν\n\n15\n\n\n\n\nReturning nothing\nSometimes you don’t want a function to return any values at all. For example, you might want a function that only prints a string to the console.\n\nfunction print_some_string(x)\n    println(\"x: $x\")\n    return nothing\nend\nprint_some_string(42)\n\nx: 42"

The two main types of loops are while loops and for loops.\n\nWhile loops\nwhile loops continue to evaluate an expression so long as a specified boolean condition is true. This is useful when you don’t know how many iterations it will take for the desired goal to be reached.\n\nfunction compute_factorial(x)\n    factorial = 1\n    while (x &gt; 1)\n        factorial *= x\n        x -= 1\n    end\n    return factorial\nend\ncompute_factorial(5)\n\n120\n\n\n\nWhile loops can easily turn into infinite loops if the condition is never meaningfully updated. Be careful, and look there if your programs are getting stuck.

    "text": "Overview\nThis tutorial will demonstrate how to solve linear optimization problems graphically and using the JuMP package in Julia. It draws heavily from this tutorial by Jesse D. Jenkins and Michael R. Davidson.\nJuMP (“Julia for Mathematical Programming”) is an open-source Julia package that adds functionality for formulating and solving a variety of optimization problems. One advantage of JuMP is that its syntax matches the typical mathematical formalism used to specify optimization problems. We will use JuMP in this class for our optimization work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the Documentation!\n\n\n\nMake sure that you take a look at the JuMP documentation whenever you have a question or want to find out how to do something that we don’t discuss in any of our tutorials or lectures (or how to do it better!)."

    "text": "Setup\nHere we will outline the basic steps for configuring JuMP, though you can also refer to the official Installation Guide.\nIf JuMP is not already in your environment (it will be for any of your assignments, but may not be if you’re doing something independently), you will need to install it. You will also need to select a solver and install the relevant package. Some of these are commercial, while others are open source. Solvers are also not typically universal, as different types of optimization problems use different algorithms, so be aware of what problem you’re trying to solve instead of just blindly copying code from one task to another.\nFor example, for the linear programming example, we will use the HiGHS solver via the HiGHS.jl package. As seen on the solver table, HiGHS is open source (via the MIT license) and can solve linear programs (LP) and mixed-integer linear programs (MILP), as well as quadratic programs (which we won’t discuss in this course)."

    "text": "Linear Programming Example: How Many Widgets Should A Factory Produce?\n\nDefining The Problem\nSuppose we own a factory that can produce two types of widgets:\n\nWidget A generates a profit of \\(p_A = \\$100\\) per widget; and\nWidget B generates a profit of \\(p_B = \\$75\\) per widget.\n\nLet \\(x\\) be the number of units of widget A that we want to produce, and \\(y\\) the number of units of widget B. Our goal is to maximize our total profit \\(p_Ax + p_By\\). This is the objective function. We express this objective using the equation \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\max_{x, y} 100x + 75y. \\label{eq:objective}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis isn’t a very interesting problem yet! We would simply build as much of both widgets as we could, because there are no constraints on our ability to produce. To make this more realistic, let’s suppose that both widgets are produced using the same raw material \\(M\\), of which we can only procure 300 units. Then, if:\n\nWidget A requires 40 units of \\(M\\) per widget, and\nWidget B requires 20 units of \\(M\\) per widget, we arrive at the following material constraint: \\[\\begin{equation}\n40x + 20y \\leq 300. \\label{eq:constraint1}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nBut we might have another constraint: time! Each widget may take a different amount of labor to produce. For example, let’s say that\n\nWidget A takes 6 hours to produce and\nWidget B takes 12 hours to produce. Further, there are only 80 hours per work that can be allocated to widget production. This becomes the time constraint \\[\\begin{equation}\n6x + 12y \\leq 80. \\label{eq:constraint2}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nFinally, we cannot build a negative number of either type of widget. This is known as a non-negativity constraint, and can be expressed as\n\\[\\begin{align}\nx &\\geq 0 \\label{eq:constraintx} \\\\\ny &\\geq 0 \\label{eq:constrainty}\n\\end{align}\\]\nConsolidating equations \\(\\eqref{eq:objective}\\)–\\(\\eqref{eq:constrainty}\\) gives us the following constrained optimization problem:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\max_{x, y} & 100x + 75y\\\\\n&\\text{subject to} & \\\\\n& & 40x + 20y \\leq 300\\\\\n& & 6x + 12y \\leq 80\\\\\n& & x \\geq 0\\\\\n& & y \\geq 0\n\\end{aligned} \\label{eq:widget}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nVisualizing the Problem\nLet’s do some plotting to examine the geometry of our optimization problem. We can do this using the Plots.jl package in Julia.\n\n## set up objective function parameters and variables\npa = 100\npb = 75\na = range(0, 8, step=0.25)\nb = range(0, 8, step=0.25)\n\n## define objective function\nf(a, b) = pa * a + pb * b\n\n## start plotting\ncontour(a,b,(a,b)-&gt;f(a,b),nlevels=15, c=:heat, linewidth=10, colorbar = false, contour_labels = true) # objective function contours\ntitle!(\"Factory Optimization Problem\") # add title\nxaxis!(\"x=Widget A\", lims=(0, maximum(a))) # add x-axis title and limits\nyaxis!(\"y=Widget B\", lims=(0, maximum(b))) # add y-axis title and limits\nxticks!(0:maximum(a)) # set x-axis ticks\nyticks!(0:maximum(b)) # set y-axis ticks\nareaplot!(a[a.&lt;=11], (300 .- 40*a)./20, legend=false, opacity=0.3) # plot materials constraint feasible region\nareaplot!(a[a.&lt;=8], (80 .- 6*a)./12, legend=false, opacity=0.3) # plot time constraint feasible region\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Decision space for the widget linear program \\(\\eqref{eq:widget}\\).

    "section": "Solving This Problem Using JuMP",
    "text": "Solving This Problem Using JuMP\n\nSetting Up the Model and Solver\nTo solve our problem, first we need to define the model. The model object has lots of attributes, including the variables, constraints, solver options, etc. We create a new model using the Model() function. Since we are using the HiGHS solver, we need to tell JuMP to use the HiGHS.Optimizer solver function.\n\nfactory_model = Model(HiGHS.Optimizer) \n\nThere are a bunch of attributes and options that we could set, but we won’t in this example. If needed, look at the HiGHS.jl documentation.\n\nDefine Variables\nDecision variables (\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in this case) in JuMP are defined using the @variable macro. The first argument passed to @variable() is the model object, in this case, factory_model, and the second argument are bounds on that variable, created using &gt;= and &lt;=. JuMP will interpret the bound specification to obtain the variable name. In this case, our only bounds directly on the variables are the non-negativity constraints.\n\n@variable(factory_model, x &gt;= 0)\n@variable(factory_model, y &gt;= 0)\n\nIf we had a free (or unbounded) variable \\(z\\), we could declare that variable using @variable(model, z). JuMP also requires unique names for each variable, or it will throw an error. This is one place where it’s nice that Julia lets us use sub- and superscripts in variable names!\nIf we did want to modify the bounds after defining the variable, we could do so using the set_lower_bound and set_upper_bound functions, or we could remove them using delete_lower_bound and delete_upper_bound.\nFinally, if we want to see all of the variables associated with a model, we can use the all_variables function to obtain an array.\n\nall_variables(factory_model)\n\n2-element Vector{VariableRef}:\n x\n y\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine Constraints\nWhen defining variables, we were able to declare constraints on their values by specifying upper and lower bounds. However, we also have other constraints, which involve multiple decision variables. These are specified using the @constraint macro. Unlike variables, we also need to pass names for each constraint. We will use time for the time constraint and materials for the materials constraint. These names must be unique.\n\n@constraint(factory_model, time, 6x + 12y &lt;= 80) # specify the time constraint\n@constraint(factory_model, materials, 40x + 20y &lt;= 300) # materials constraint\n\n\n\nDefine Objective Function\nSo far, we’ve defined the feasible region of the decision-variable domain by setting the constraints. But we need to specify our objective function to know what we are trying to minimize or maximize over this region. We define the objective function using the @objective macro. In addition to specifying the model objective and the function, we need to tell JuMP whether we want to minimize or maximize.\n\n@objective(factory_model, Max, 100x + 75y)\n\n\n\nLooking At The Full Model\nNow, let’s look at the model specification. print() will print out a formatted version of the model; in a notebook (or on this page), that will be marked up with LaTeX, in a REPL terminal, it will not be.\n\nprint(factory_model)\n\n\\[ \\begin{aligned}\n\\max\\quad & 100 x + 75 y\\\\\n\\text{Subject to} \\quad & 6 x + 12 y \\leq 80\\\\\n& 40 x + 20 y \\leq 300\\\\\n& x \\geq 0\\\\\n& y \\geq 0\\\\\n\\end{aligned} \\]\n\n\nIf you want a LaTeX-marked up version in the REPL, use latex_formulation().\nWe won’t go into detail here, but there are other ways to define the model, which are detailed in the JuMP documentation. For example, we can specify multiple variables using @variables. Similarly, we can use @constraints to define multiple constraints at once. Or we can use loops to define multiple constraints or constraints involving many variables. We can also specify the model in vectorized syntax, which is similar to how linear programs are specified in MATLAB.\n\n\nSolve the Model\nNow it’s time to solve the model and find the optimal values \\((x^*, y^*)\\). Since we specified the solver when we initialized factory_model, all we have to do is call the optimize! function.\n\noptimize!(factory_model)\n\nRunning HiGHS 1.5.3 [date: 1970-01-01, git hash: 45a127b78]\nCopyright (c) 2023 HiGHS under MIT licence terms\nPresolving model\n2 rows, 2 cols, 4 nonzeros\n2 rows, 2 cols, 4 nonzeros\nPresolve : Reductions: rows 2(-0); columns 2(-0); elements 4(-0) - Not reduced\nProblem not reduced by presolve: solving the LP\nUsing EKK dual simplex solver - serial\n  Iteration        Objective     Infeasibilities num(sum)\n          0    -1.0937489944e+01 Ph1: 2(4.125); Du: 2(10.9375) 0s\n          2     8.4722222222e+02 Pr: 0(0) 0s\nModel   status      : Optimal\nSimplex   iterations: 2\nObjective value     :  8.4722222222e+02\nHiGHS run time      :          0.00\n\n\n\n\nQuery the Solution\nTo find the optimal values of our decision variables, we need to query the values of the variables using value.(). We use value.() (the vectorized version of value()) because JuMP stores decision variables differently depending on their number and how they were defined.

The blue dot shows the optimal solution.\n\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, the optimal solution \\[(x^*, y^*)\\] is exactly where we deduced it would be geometrically.\n\n\nOther Stuff We Can Do\nWe can also use value.() to evaluate our constraints without manually using the equations.\n\nvalue.(time)\n\n80.0\n\n\n\nvalue.(materials)\n\n300.0\n\n\nWhat if we also want the optimal objective value? We can obtain this using objective_value().\n\nobjective_value(factory_model)\n\n847.2222222222221\n\n\nWe could also define other expressions via the @expression macro as functions of the decision variables and evaluate those. For example, let’s say that we wanted to know the total number of widgets we’d produce under our optimal allocation of resources.\n\n@expression(factory_model, total_widgets, x+y)\nvalue.(total_widgets)\n\n9.444444444444443\n\n\n\n\nDual Solutions\nWe can identify if our model has a dual solution by calling has_duals().\n\nhas_duals(factory_model)\n\ntrue\n\n\nIf we want to know the dual solution associated with a constraint, we use the shadow_price() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaming Constraints\n\n\n\nModifying constraints and querying for dual solutions is the reason why it’s important to give constraints individual names.\n\n\n\nshadow_price(time)\n\n2.777777777777777\n\n\n\nshadow_price(materials)\n\n2.0833333333333335\n\n\nIf the binding constraint was a variable bound, we could also query that shadow price by calling reduced_cost() on the variable.\n\nreduced_cost(x)\n\n-0.0\n\n\n\nreduced_cost(y)\n\n-0.0\n\n\nIn this case, the relevant shadow prices are zero because the optimum is in the interior of the domain. If we had added a strong enough upper bound on the value(s) of one or both of our decision variables (say, \\(x \\leq 4\\)), then this would be non-zero."

Feel free to experiment, though!\nSince we’ll be generating random numbers, let’s import Random.jl to let us set a seed to reproduce the same plot in addition to Plots.jl.\n\nusing Plots\nusing LaTeXStrings\nusing Measures\nusing Random\nRandom.seed!(1);\n\nFirst, to generate a basic line plot, use plot():\n\ny = rand(5)\nplot(y, label=\"original data\", legend=:topleft)\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could also explicitly pass \\(x\\)-axis coordinates by passing an array with these coordinates first, as in plot(x, y, ...). If only one array is passed, Plots.jl will interpret the values as \\(y\\) coordinates and use their indices for the \\(x\\) positions.\nNotice the use of the label and legend keywords to label the plot element and position the legend. To not label a particular plotting element, use label=false, and to turn off any legend (including a colorbar) from the plot, use legend=false.\nNow we can add some other lines and point markers. We will use plot! and scatter! to add another line and some points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMutating Function\n\n\n\nThe exclamation mark says that plot!() is a mutating function, which changes an existing variable instead of creating a new one. In this case, these functions change or add to an existing plot, instead of creating a new one.\n\n\nNotice the arguments in plot!() and scatter!(), which let us set properties for the line and scatterplot markers.\n\ny2 = rand(5)\ny3 = rand(5)\nplot!(y2, color=:red, linewidth=2, linestyle=:dot, label=\"new data\")\nscatter!(y3, markercolor=:black, markershape=:square, markersize=5, label=\"even more data\")\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s now add axis labels. We can use LaTeX syntax to add mathematical markup elements to labels (such as superscripts, subscripts, Greek letters, and mathematical symbols) using the LaTeXStrings.jl package. If we indicate that a string should be interpreted as a LaTeXString using the L\"...\" syntax, it will render content inside $..$ using LaTeX, as seen below.\n\nxlabel!(\"Regular String (days)\")\nylabel!(L\"LaTeX String $x_2$ (m$^3$)\")\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving Plot Elements\nSometimes we want to remove legends, axes, grid lines, and/or ticks.\n\nplot!(legend=false, axis=false, grid=false, ticks=false)\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that this unintentionally modified the image dimensions to move the axis labels off the page.

As engineers, our work touches on many critical aspects of society, and questions of inclusion and social justice cannot be separated from considerations of systems analysis, objective selection, risk analysis, and trade-offs.\nIn all communications and interactions with each other, members of this class community (students and instructors) are expected to be respectful and inclusive. In this spirit, we ask all participants to:\n\nshare their experiences, values, and beliefs;\nbe open to and respectful of the views of others; and\nvalue each other’s opinions and communicate in a respectful manner.\n\nPlease let me know if you feel any aspect(s) of class could be made more inclusive. Please also share any preferred name(s) and/or your pronouns with me if you wish: I use he/him/his, and you can refer to me either as Vivek or Prof. Srikrishnan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease, Be Excellent To Teach Other\n\n\n\nWe all make mistakes in our communications with one another, both when speaking and listening. Be mindful of how spoken or written language might be misunderstood, and be aware that, for a variety of reasons, how others perceive your words and actions may not be exactly how you intended them. At the same time, it is also essential that we be respectful and interpret each other’s comments and actions in good faith.\n\n\n\n\nStudent Accomodations\nLet me know if you have any access barriers in this course, whether they relate to course materials, assignments, or communications. If any special accomodations would help you navigate any barriers and improve your chances of success, please exercise your right to those accomodations and reach out to me as early as possible with your Student Disability Services (SDS) accomodation letter. This will ensure that we have enough time to make appropriate arrangements.\nIf you need more immediate accomodations, but do not yet have a letter, please let me know and then follow up with SDS.\n\n\nCourse Communications\nMost course communications will occur via Ed Discussion. Public Ed posts are generally preferred to private posts or emails, as other students can benefit from the discussions. If you would like to discuss something privately, please do reach out through email or a private Ed post (which will only be viewable by you and the course staff).\nAnnouncements will be made on the course website and in Ed. Emergency announcements will also be made on Canvas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEd Tips\n\n\n\n\nIf you wait until the day an assignment is due (or even late the previous night) to ask a question on Ed, there is a strong chance that I will not see your post prior to the deadline.\nBut if you see unanswered questions and you have some insight, please answer! This class will work best when we all work together as a community.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health Resources\nWe all have to take care of our mental health, just as we would our physical health. As a student, you may experience a range of issues which can negatively impact your mental health. Please do not ignore any of these stressors, or feel like you have to navigate these challenges alone! You are part of a community of students, faculty, and staff, who have a responsibility to look for one another’s well-being. If you are struggling with managing your mental health, or if you believe a classmate may be struggling, please reach out to the course instructor, the TA, or, for broader support, please take advantage of Cornell’s mental health resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health And This Class\n\n\n\nI am not a trained counselor, but I am here to support you in whatever capacity we can. You should never feel that you need to push yourself past your limits to complete any assignment for this class or any other. If we need to make modifications to the course or assignment schedule, you can certainly reach out to me, and all relevant discussions will be kept strictly confidential."

    "text": "Course Policies\n\nAttendance\nAttendance is not required, but in general, students who attend class regularly will do better and get more out of the class than students who do not. Your class participation grade will reflect both the quantity and quality of your participation, only some of which can occur asynchronously. I will put as many course materials, such as lecture notes and announcements, as possible online, but viewing materials online is not the same as active participation and engagement. Life happens, of course, and this may lead you to miss class. Let me know if you need any appropriate arrangements ahead of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat If I’m Sick?\n\n\n\nPlease stay home if you’re feeling sick! This is beneficial for both for your own recovery and the health and safety of your classmates. We will also make any necessary arrangements for you to stay on top of the class material and if whatever is going on will negatively impact your grade, for example by causing you to be unable to submit an assignment on time.\n\n\n\n\nMask Policies\nMasks are encouraged but not required in the classroom, per university policy. However, the University strongly encourages compliance with requests to mask from students, faculty, and staff who are concerned about the risk of infection. Please be respectful of these concerns and requests if you cannot wear a mask.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat, copy, or plagiarize!\n\n\nThis class is designed to encourage collaboration, and students are encouraged to discuss their work with other students. However, I expect students to abide by the Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity in all aspects of this class. All work submitted must represent the students’ own work and understanding, whether individually or as a group (depending on the particulars of the assignment). This includes analyses, code, software runs, and reports. Engineering as a profession relies upon the honesty and integrity of its practitioners (see e.g. the American Society for Civil Engineers’ Code of Ethics).\n\n\nExternal Resources\nThe collaborative environment in this class should not be viewed as an invitation for plagiarism. Plagiarism occurs when a writer intentionally misrepresents another’s words or ideas (including code!) as their own without acknowledging the source. All external resources which are consulted while working on an assignment should be referenced, including other students and faculty with whom the assignment is discussed. You will never be penalized for consulting an external source for help and referencing it, but plagiarism will result in a zero for that assignment as well as the potential for your case to be passed on for additional disciplinary action.\n\n\nAI/ML Resource Policy\nAs noted, all work submitted for a grade in this course must reflect your own understanding. The use and consulation of AI/ML tools, such as ChatGPT or similar, must be pre-approved and clearly referenced. If approved, you must:\n\nreference the URL of the service you are using, including the specific date you accessed it;\nprovide the exact query or queries used to interact with the tool; and\nreport the exact response received.\n\nFailure to attain prior approval or fully reference the interaction, as described above, will be treated as plagiarism and referred to the University accordingly.\n\n\nLate Work Policy\nIn general, late work will be subjected to a 10% penalty per day, which can accumulate to 100% of the total grade. However, sometimes things come up in life. Please reach out ahead of time if you have extenuating circumstances (including University-approved absences or illnesses) which would make it difficult for you to submit your work on time. Work which would be late for appropriate reasons will be given extensions and the late penalty will be waived."

    "text": "Assessments\n\nLab Notebooks: 20%\nSome classes will involve hands-on exercises (which we will call “labs”) which will give you guided practice applying the concepts and methods from class. These classes will be announced on the course website ahead of time so anyone who is able can bring a laptop to class, and notebooks will be provided on GitHub. These labs can be done in groups; if you cannot bring a laptop to class for whatever reason, you will be able to (and are encouraged to) work with other students, though you must turn in your own notebook for grading.\nSome details on lab logistics:\n\nSome of the labs may some time outside of class, but they will not be as intensive as a homework assignment.\nYou will be required to submit a PDF of your completed notebook to Gradescope by 9:00pm by the due date (which will be approximately one week) after the lab session. Tag the answers to each question: points will be deducted if this is not done.\nWhile your lowest lab grade will not be dropped, late penalties will be waived for appropriate reasons discussed with the instructor (ideally ahead of time when circumstances allow).\nRubrics will be provided for lab grading as part of the lab assignments.\n\n\n\nHomework Assignments: 40%\nApproximately 5-6 homework assignments will be assigned throughout the semester; the specifics depend on how quickly we move through the material. You will typically have 10 days to 2 weeks to work on Students are encouraged to collaborate and learn from each other on homework assignments, but each student must submit their own solutions reflecting their understanding of the material. Consulting and referencing external resources and your peers is encouraged (engineering is a collaborative discipline!), but plagiarism is a violation of academic integrity.\nSome notes on assignment and grading logistics:\n\nHomework assignments will be distributed using GitHub Classroom. Students should make sure they update their GitHub repositories as they work on the assignments; this helps with answering questions and gives you a backstop in case something goes wrong and you can’t submit your assignment on time.\nHomeworks are due by 9:00pm Eastern Time on the designed due date. Your assignment notebook (which include your writeup and codes) should be submitted to Gradescope as a PDF with the answers to each question tagged (a failure to do this will result in deductions).\nRubrics will be provided for the homeworks as part of the assignments.\nYour lowest homework grade will be dropped. We can discuss arrangements if multiple assignments will be missed for university-approved reasons, preferably ahead of time.\nRegrade requests for specific problems must be made within a week of the grading of that assignment. However, note that regrades can cut both ways: the TA can take away points as well!\n\n\n\nFinal Term Project: 40%\nThis course will culminate with a term project with a topic selected from a suggested list (provided mid-semester). The goal of this project is to apply and extend the tools and approaches we will learn in class. While we encourage drawing on other classes or interests when developing and working on your project, submitting work from another course or work which was completed prior to the course is not permitted.\nThe term project will be completed in small groups (2-3 students) for students enrolled in BEE 4750 and individually for those in BEE 5750. The final deliverable for this project will be a poster summarizing the project and results. Ahead of that, you will submit the following:\n\na proposal for feedback on the scope of your project; and\na 2-3 page report on the status and history of a regulation of interest relevant to the system you are studying.\n\nRubrics will be provided for the components of the project."

    "text": "Instructions\n\nInstall Git\nIf you have already installed git, you don’t need to worry about this section. If you haven’t, download the appropriate version for your operating system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMac Versions\n\n\n\nIf you have a Mac, be aware if you have an Apple Silicon (M1 or M2) Mac or an Intel Mac. Many of the installations you will go through in this exercise have different versions for each processor type, and the program may not work properly if you still the wrong version. There’s nothing that can’t be undone, but it’s easier to be install the correct version first!\n\n\n\n\nInstall Julia\nI recommend installing Julia using the juliaup tool, which will let you easily manage versions in the future and works seamlessly with VS Code. The instructions can be found at the JuliaUp GitHub repository, but we will summarize them here.\n\nInstalling Juliaup on Windows\nIf your computer uses Windows, you can install Juliaup from the Windows Store.\n\n\nInstalling Juliaup on MacOS\nIf you have a Mac, open a terminal (such as the Terminal app) and enter:\ncurl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh\n\n\nInstalling Julia 1.8.5\nOnce you install Juliaup, install Julia version 1.8.5 by opening a terminal (in MacOS or Linux) or the command line (in Windows) and entering:\njulia add 1.8.5\njulia default 1.8.5\nThis will install Julia 1.8.5 and make it the default version, which should maximize package compatibility throughout this course. Going forward, if you want to add new versions or change the default, you can follow the Juliaup instructions.\n\n\n\nInstall and Set Up VS Code\nYou can skip this section if you already have a coding environment you like; just set it up to work with Julia. Otherwise, VS Code is as close to an officially supported editor for Julia as you can get. We will follow this guide for setting up VS Code with Julia.\n\nInstalling VS Code\nYou can download it here; open the downloaded file to install.\n\n\nInstall the Julia Extension\n\nOpen VS Code.\nSelect View and click Extensions to open the Extension View. This view can also be found on the sidebar with the following logo:\n.\nSearch for julia in the search box. Click the green install button.\nRestart VS Code once the installation is complete. It should automatically find your Julia installation; talk to Vivek if not.\n\nThe Julia VS Code extension offers you some nice features. You can start a REPL (an interactive Julia coding environment) by opening the “Command Palette” (View -&gt; Command Palette, or CTRL/CMD+SHIFT+P) and typing “REPL” to bring up “Julia: Start REPL”. You can also create *.jl files to write Julia code and execute line by line. However, we will primarily use Jupyter notebooks in this class, but this might be useful for testing code or for your project.\n\n\nInstall the Jupyter Notebook Extension\nThe Jupyter Notebook extension allows you to export a Jupyter notebook to PDF or to HTML and then to PDF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPDF Export for Gradescope\n\n\n\nYou will need to export every notebook to a PDF for submission to Gradescope. Direct export to PDF requires a LaTeX installation. If you would like to go this route, please look at the LaTeX installation instructions for your operating system.\nOtherwise, exporting to HTML and then using your browser to save the resulting page to a PDF is a perfect solution.\n\n\nFollow the same instructions as above, but search for jupyter and install the Jupyter extension. Restart VS Code.\n\n\n\nSet Up GitHub\n\nCreate GitHub Account\nIf you already have a GitHub account, you can use that for this course and do not need to create a new account.\nOtherwise, create an account. It doesn’t have to be linked to your Cornell email or use your Cornell NetID.\nFor labs and homework assignments (we will work on Lab 1 in class on Friday and Homework 1 is available), you should use the GitHub Classroom link to “accept” the assignment provided on Ed Discussion, which will give you your own GitHub repository for that assignment. The first time you click one of these links, you will need to link your place on the course roster with your GitHub account.\nWhen application exercises require notebook use (which is the case here, but will not always be), you can follow the workflow in these next steps, and will be prompted to do so in the instructions for that exercise.\nYou can do almost everything that you will need to do for this course with GitHub directly through VS Code, or you can use the GitHub UI or the Terminal. We will assume in these instructions that you will just work through VS Code."

## Meetings

We will have two 75-minute meetings a week, from 11:25-12:40 on Mondays and Wednesdays in 105 Riley-Robb. These meetings will usually consist of lectures, though some may focus on individual or group coding exercises and discussions.

## Office Hours

Office hours are TBD. A poll will be sent out at the beginning of the semester to find times that work for as many students as possible. If you need help outside of office hours, post on [Ed Discussion](https://us.edstem.org) or make an appointment with Prof. Srikrishnan or the TA.

## Discussions

We will use [Ed Discussion](https://us.edstem.org) for most class communications. Please ask your fellow students and the instruction staff if you have any questions or helpful comments, and if you have an answer, please share! This course works best when we all learn from each other.


## Announcements

Course announcements will be made on [Ed Discussion](https://us.edstem.org) and this website.

## Homework Assignments

Homeworks will be assigned using Github Classroom and submitted using Gradescope. We have [instructions for accessing and submitting your homework](/assignments/index.html#homework). Assignments will be graded on Gradescope. If you are sure that the TA missed something in your assignment, you can request a regrade, but note that you can also lose points if the TA notices mistakes that were overlooked in the initial grade.

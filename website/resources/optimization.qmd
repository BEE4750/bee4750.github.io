* [Decision Modeling e-Book](https://linney.mun.ca/pages/view.php?ref=36808): this uses Excel Solver, but may have useful information on problem setup and optimization methods.
* [Algorithms for Decision-Making](https://algorithmsbook.com/): open-access book based on Julia with more depth on optimization and decision-making algorithms than we will cover in this class.

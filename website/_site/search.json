    "text": "Introduction\n\nJulia\nJulia is an up-and-coming language, originally developed for scientific programming. While learning a new programming language always has its hiccups, the good news is that if you’ve programmed in a high-level language such as Python or MATLAB, most Julia concepts should look familiar. This notebook will guide you through the basics of writing Julia code and where to look for help. It was adapted from materials by Patrick Applegate and Klaus Keller (Risk Analysis in the Earth Sciences), Tony Wong, and Antonia Hadjimichael.\nIf you have not successfully set up Julia, follow the instructions in Application Exercise 1 and/or ask for help.\nYou can use other editors for this course, but our recommendation is Visual Studio Code with the Julia extension, which will make life a lot simpler! You should have set this up as part of Application Exercise 1, but if not, do so now and/or ask for help.\n\n\nJupyter Notebooks\nJupyter notebooks integrate text and equations in Markdown with Julia (or Python, or R) code. To do this, Jupyter notebooks consist of two types of “cells”: code cells and Markdown (text) cells.\nClick once on this section of text. A box will appear around this text (and some areas above/below it) - all of that is within this cell.\nMarkdown is a text markup framework for formatting language that makes things look pretty when viewed across different platforms: web browsers, notebooks, and so forth. Text written in Markdown can also include hyperlinks, LaTeX equations, section headers, and images, among other features (most of the course website and the lecture notes were all written in Markdown!). Here is a basic Markdown cheat sheet.\nWhat you are looking at right now is the formatted text after the Markdown is processed. To see the raw Markdown, do one of:\n\npress Enter while that cell is selected, or\ndouble-click on that cell.\n\n\nA couple of the features you will see in this Markdown cell:\n\nThe --- command creates a horizontal line. This is also nice for separating sections.\nBackticks (`...`) can be used to format and highlight code, keystrokes, etc.\nThe # sign is used to create a new section header; two # signs (##) is used to create a new subsection header; ### creates a subsubsection, and so on.\nYou can create a bulleted list by using the asterisk * or a dash - and a space.\nYou can create regular text by just typing as usual.\nYou can create bold-faced text by wrapping it with two asterisks on both sides.\nYou can create italicized text by wrapping it with a single asterisk on both sides.\nTo create a new paragraph, you must include a blank line between the old and new paragraphs.\n\nAt this point you might be wondering how to turn this cell back into the fully formatted Markdown text instead of the raw Markdown you’re probably still looking at. You have a couple of options, depending on your platform, but the most consistent is to type Shift + Enter to execute the cell (this is also how to run code, but more on that later).\nAdditionally, you will frequently need to create new cells in your Jupyter notebooks. How you do this will depend on how you interact with the notebook, but try to figure this out now.\nOne tip is to think carefully about what bits of code should be in the same cell, as you typically only see output from the last command in a cell. For example, compare the following:\n\nx = 5\nsin(x)\n\n-0.9589242746631385\n\n\nwith\n\nx = 5\n\n5\n\n\n\nsin(x)\n\n-0.9589242746631385\n\n\nIn Julia, you can also suppress the output of a command with a semi-colon:\n\nsin(x);\n\nwhich can help if you want to split some code out for clarity or to insert some text prior to it, but don’t want to clutter the notebook with its output.\nFor code cells, to execute the commands within the cell, we also press Shift+Enter.\nFinally, make sure that you evaluate all of the code cells in order before submitting. One bad outcome with notebooks occurs when cells are evaluated out of order, so fixed bugs and edits in previous cells do not get a chance to propagate down. You can do this with the Run All command in whichever interface you’re using to edit your notebook.\n\n\nJulia Basics\nThere are many tutorials and references for Julia, including a basics overview on the class website. Please feel free to reference these as you work through any part of the course.\n\n\nFormatting Math\nIt will often be helpful to include nicely-formatted mathematics in a notebook. Markdown accomodates this using LaTeX syntax. A LaTeX cheatsheet is available on the class website, and many other guides exist online.\nBelow is an example of a formatted equation: \\[x = 5\\].\n\n\nLooking For Help\nThere is no shame in using Google, or other resources, for help when programming. There are many, many times when you can’t quite get the syntax to work, can’t quite figure out the right package or command to use, or are feeling too lazy or overwhelmed (I’m not judging either of those!) to dig through the documentation. Some good resources include:\n\nStack Overflow is a treasure trove of answers;\nThe official Julia forum and the Julia Subreddit are also very useful.\n\nYou are also highly encouraged to post on Ed Discussion, though getting a response might be less immediate. Just be mindful that to get good answers, you have to help people help you, and make sure to give credit to any resources that were helpful!"

Convert your completed notebook to a PDF and submit it to the Gradescope Assignment “Lab 1”.\nRemember to:\n\nEvaluate all of your code cells, in order (using a Run All command). This will make sure all output is visible and that the code cells were evaluated in the correct order.\nTag each of the problems when you submit to Gradescope; a 10% penalty will be deducted if this is not done.\n\n\nExercise 1\nGiven two numeric arrays x and y, write a function to compute their dot product if they have equal length, and return an error if not (this is useful for debugging!). Use the following code as a starting point.\n\nfunction dot_product(x, y)\n    if ... # insert test condition for equal lengths\n        # compute and return dot product\n    else\n        throw(DimensionMismatch(\"length of x not equal to length of y\"))\n    end\nend\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nThis problem involves implementing Newton’s method for computing square roots; it was shamelessly copied from MIT’s Introduction to Computational Thinking. You will use a while loop instead of the for loop above.\nImplement the following algorithm in a function newton_sqrt:\nGiven $x > 0:\n\nTake a guess \\(a\\).\nDivide \\(x\\) by \\(a\\).\n\nUpdate \\(a\\) as the average of \\(x/a\\) and \\(a\\).\nRepeat until \\(x/a\\) is within a tolerance of \\(\\varepsilon\\) from \\(a\\).\nReturn \\(a \\approx \\sqrt{x}\\).\n\nUse your newton_sqrt function to compute \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) to within a tolerance of \\(\\varepsilon = 0.01\\).\n\n\nExercise 3: Making a Plot\nWrite a function to compute the square of an integer x. Evaluate this function for integers between \\(x=-5\\) and \\(x=5\\) and make a plot of the squared values (you can find a quick guide to making various types of plots here). Make sure to label your axes.\n\nusing Plots\n\n# insert your code here"

    "text": "Getting Assignments\nWe will use GitHub Classroom to manage assignments and projects this semester. GitHub Classroom will send out invites when assignments are ready, and will create an individual or group repository for you to work in. You will need a GitHub account.\n\nWhy Are We Using GitHub Classroom?\nWe are using GitHub in this class for a number of reasons.\n\nVersion control is a best practice for software, and many of you are likely to take jobs which involve working with code.\nGitHub Classroom makes it easy to assign and collect group and individual assignments. You’ll receive an email when an assignment is ready, and the repository will be automatically set up on GitHub, so all you have to do is clone it to your computer.\nAs GitHub allows code others to view and comment on code, it also facilitates collective debugging with classmates and instructors, rather than requiring us to work off shared screenshots or email threads. You can just share the link to your assignment repository on Slack and we can see the current state of your code, as well as any previous versions.\nFinally, GitHub provides documentation of the state of your code at any given time, so if there is a hiccup in submission to Gradescope, you have proof that your code was effectively ready on time!\n\n\n\nAccepting An Assignment\nWhen we release an assignment, you will receive an email from GitHub Classroom containing an invitation link. This link will be provided in a pinned post in the relevant Ed Discussion forum. When you click on this link, GitHub Classroom will ask you if you want to accept the invitation. If you answer “yes,” a new repository will be created for you containing the repository template. In this class, this template will include the following files.\n\ninstructions.pdf file containing the assignment details (also instructions.jmd, which is the source file for the PDF; feel free to look around that file if you want to see how anything was implemented).\nProject.toml, which is a file specifying the Julia packages and their versions which should be installed (you won’t have to do anything with this file, but it’s provided to reduce the risk of any issues with package versions. This environment will be automatically loaded (and any needed packages installed) before your code is compiled, so you don’t need to explicitly do so in your report. The list of packages which are included in the environment will be provided in the repository README. For each assignment, this environment should be sufficient, but if you come across another package you want to use, feel free to use Julia’s Pkg package manager to add it.\nsolution-template.jmd file which is a template for your solution report. For the most part, this is the only file you will need to rename/change.\ncompile_report.jl, which contains code to compile the report into a PDF or an HTML. You won’t need to touch this.\nSome other files consisting of templates and git/GitHub configuration; you don’t need to touch any of these.\n\nYour new repository will be called “hwx- and will be linked to your account (and listed under the list of your account’s repositories)."

    "section": "Assignment Report Writing",
    "text": "Assignment Report Writing\nA Weave report combines Markdown (for written text) and Julia code into a single, integrated .jmd file. You can insert Julia variables into the written portion and their values will be inserted as if you’ve typed them in yourself. Plots can also be generated upon compilation, rather than needing to produce them in Julia and then inserting them in manually.\nA Weave file consists of several parts: 1. a header (in YAML), which you should only need to modify from the template with your name and NetID; 2. Markdown (specifically, Julia Markdown); 3. Julia code chunks.\nEach assignment repository will include a solution-template.jmd file for you to use as a starting point.\n\nCode Chunks\nCode chunks are specified as they usually are in Markdown:\n```julia\n...\n```\nThese chunks will be evaluated as if you were running a normal Julia script.\nThere are several options which can be specified when defining a chunk. You won’t have to play with many of these (we have set up defaults in the YAML header, such as echoing code and not caching results). The exception might be for specifying figure sizes and captions when you insert plots. You can play with these if you want, particularly if you want to use LaTeX-style figure referencing.\n\n\nInline Code\nIf you want to evaluate Julia code inline (such as writing a statement which includes a variable value), use `j expr`. For example, The minimum value is `j min(C)`.\n\n\nTypesetting Math\nYou can typeset math using LaTeX syntax. Inline, use double backticks, such as ``x^2``. For large LaTeX equations or sections of math, you can use a code chunk with the “math” language:\n```math\n...\n```\nSo, to specify an optimization model in standard form (which you will need to do for a few assignments), you could do a variation on:\n```math\n\\begin{alignat*}{2}\n& &\\max 100x + 75y\\\\\n&\\text{subject to} & \\\\\n& & x \\geq 0\\\\\n& & y \\geq 0 \\\\\n& & 40x + 20y \\leq 300\\\\\n& & 6x + 12y \\leq 80\n\\end{alignat*}\n```\nwhich would be rendered as @@no-number \\[\n\\begin{alignat*}{2}\n& &\\max 100x + 75y\\\\\n&\\text{subject to} & \\\\\n& & x \\geq 0\\\\\n& & y \\geq 0 \\\\\n& & 40x + 20y \\leq 300\\\\\n& & 6x + 12y \\leq 80\n\\end{alignat*}\n\\] @@\n\n\nCompiling Your Report\nFinally, when you’re ready to compile the report to check your solution or how everything looks, navigate to the repository directory. We’ve included a script in compile_report.jl that will load the environment, install any needed packages, and compile your report into either a PDF or HTML (if you don’t want to bother with LaTeX). From the command line:\njulia compile_report.jl <solution-filename.jmd> <output-type>\nwhere output-type is optional (it will try to compile to a PDF if this is not included, or you can explicitly specify “pdf” or “html”). If you have the Julia REPL open and want to try to compile your code:\ninclude(\"compile_report.jl\")\ncompile_report(\"solution-filename.jmd\", output-type)"

For Problems 1–3, you will be asked to identify relevant error(s) and fix the code. For Problem 4, the code works as intended; your goal is to identify the code’s purpose by following its logic.\nTo write and evaluate Julia code, encode your code in a “Julia chunk”. To do this, use the following syntax:\n```julia\n# insert your code here\n\n\\note{Those are backticks `` ` ``, *not* apostrophes `` ' ``!}\n\n## Problems\n\n### Problem 1 (25 points)\n\nYou've been tasked with writing code to identify the minimum value in an array. You cannot use a predefined function. Your colleague suggested the function below, but it does not return the minimum value.\n\n```julia:./code/ex1\nfunction minimum(array)\n    min_value = 0 # variable which stores minimum value\n    for i in 1:length(array)\n        if array[i] < min_value\n            min_value = array[i]\n        end\n    end\n    return min_value\nend\n\narray_values = [89, 90, 95, 100, 100, 78, 99, 98, 100, 95]\n@show minimum(array_values)\n\nProblem 1.1 (10 points)\nDescribe the logic error.\n\n\nProblem 1.2 (10 points)\nWrite a fixed version of the function.\n\n\nProblem 1.3 (5 points)\nUse your fixed function to find the minimum value of array_values.\n\n\n\nProblem 2\nYour team is trying to compute the average grade for your class, but the following code produces an error.\nstudent_grades = [89, 90, 95, 100, 100, 78, 99, 98, 100, 95]\n\nfunction class_average(grades)\n  average_grade = mean(student_grades)\n  return average_grade\n\n@show average_grade\n\nProblem 2.1\nDescribe the logic and/or syntax error.\n\n\nProblem 1.2\nWrite a fixed version of the code.\n\n\nProblem 1.3\nUse your fixed code to compute the average grade for the class.\n\n\n\nProblem 3\nYour team has collected data on the mileage of different car models. You want to calculate the average mileage per gallon (MPG) for the different cars, but your code produces an error.\n# function to calculate MPG given a tuple of miles and gallons\nfunction calculate_MPG((miles, gallons))\n    return miles / gallons\nend\n\ncar_miles =  [(334, 11), (289, 15), (306, 12), (303, 20), (350, 20), (294, 14)]\n\nmpg = zeros(length(car_miles))\n\nfor i in 1:length(car_miles)\n    miles = car_miles[1][1]\n    gallon = car_miles[1][2]\n    mpg[i] = calculate_MPG((miles, gallon))\nend  \n@show mpg\nDescribe the logic error.\n\nProblem 3.2\nWrite a fixed version of the code.\n\n\nProblem 3.3\nUse your fixed code to compute the MPGs.\n\n\n\nProblem 4\nYou’ve been handed some code to analyze. The original coder was not very considerate of other potential users: the function is called mystery_function and there are no comments explaining the purpose of the code. It appears to take in an array and return some numbers, and you’ve been assured that the code works as intended.\nfunction mystery_function(values)\n    y = []\n    for v in values\n        if !(v in y)\n            append!(y, v)\n        end\n    end\n    return y\nend\n\nlist_of_values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 2, 1]\n@show mystery_function(list_of_values)\n\nProblem 4.1\nExplain the purpose of mystery_function.\n\n\nProblem 4.2\nAdd comments to each line of code, explaining what it is doing and why.\n\n\n\nProblem 5\nThis problem is required for students in BEE 5750 and is extra credit for students in BEE 4750.\nWrite a version of the code in Problem 3 that uses broadcasting instead of a for loop. Based on what you’ve learned about Julia, why might this be a preferable solution for this problem?"

    "text": "Julia is open source. It has a great balance between intuitive syntax and speed. It was originally designed to share MATLAB’s mathematically-oriented syntax and Python’s readability. It can be used interactively, as more of a “scripting” language, but can be optimized to run code almost as quickly as C/C++. And it has a committed development base which is actively extending its capabilities: JuMP.jl lets us program optimization problems in a syntax that’s very close to the mathematical expressions, and the Turing.jl ecosystem has added some fantastic statistical and machine-learning libraries, among others. It’s becoming a common language among power systems modelers and environmental economists, among other applied communities.\nWhy not some common alternatives?\n\nR is fantastic for statistics, but it has a very unique syntax, and can be slow and struggles to scale to large-scale problems; while we won’t approach those limits in this class, there’s no need to go there for our purposes.\nPython is extremely readable, but also can be very slow unless you’re using libraries which are written in C++, and the syntax for these can be jarringly different than native Python.\nC/C++ are overkill for this class, and focusing on them would distract from our core engineering learning objectives.\nMATLAB is not free or open source. It also has some features which do not align with good broader coding and code maintainance practices (for example, having a single long function per file).\n\nUltimately, there are trade-offs with any language, and in this case, some specifics of Julia syntax and coding style may take an adjustment, but the pros outweigh the cons given the variety of programming tasks that we will be doing in this course.\n\n\n\nThere are a few on the Julia Resources page; please suggest additional resources!"

Anecdotally, adding GitHub to your skillset is a great resume booster for engineers who work in computing-heavy environments. For the purposes of our class, GitHub facilitates:\n\nAssignment management through GitHub Classroom;\nSharing of code/notebooks for debugging and asking for help (otherwise, I end up with many files with the same name, and might not open the right one…);\nUsing your repository as your submission in case something goes wrong and you can’t submit your completed assignment on time.\n\n\n\nWhat level of GitHub familiarity will I need?\nNone from the start! And the following commands are all you will need for this course (you can also use GitHub Desktop or use the GitHub functionality in VS Code, which we will discuss in class):\n\ngit clone <github-repository-url>: This is needed to “clone” your assignment repository (initialize your local repository).\ngit commit -m <message>: This is used to “lock in” changes that you’ve made to your files. You should make commits frequently as you make changes so you can revert to prior versions if something goes wrong (and make your messages meaningful so you know what changes you’ve made!)\ngit push: This syncs any committed changes to the remote GitHub repository. You must do this prior to using your repository to ask for help."

    "text": "Assignments (Homework, Labs, and AEs)\n\nHow do I access assignments?\nWe will use GitHub Classroom to manage assessments. Links to accept the assignments and create your repository will be posted on Ed Discussion as they are released, and posts with the links for active assignments will be pinned. The class schedule will link to a page which has a preview of the assignment, but links are not provided from this page to accept the assignment.\nFor the first assignment you accept, you will need to link your GitHub account to your entry in the class roster. You will not need to do this again for the rest of the semester.\n\n\nWhat if there’s an error in the assignment repository?\nThat’s certainly possible! If you believe I’ve made a mistake in writing the assignment, please document it in the Ed Discussion forum. I’ll describe steps for how to fix your files (unfortunately, I can’t do this remotely and push it to everyone’s repositories).\n\n\nHelp! My code isn’t working.\nHere are some steps I would follow:\n\nSearch for the error message you’re seeing. Often, you can find posts in the r/Julia subreddit, the official Julia forum, or Stack Overflow for the same or similar issues. You should do this first: if you can find the answer this way, it will be faster than other options, and if you can rule out some approaches that you’ve already tried, it will make the following steps go more smoothly.\nPost on Ed Discussion. For the most effective help, follow the following guidelines (adapted from Stack Overflow’s “How Do I Ask A Good Question?”):\n\nMake your post subject specific and descriptive. “Problem with HW 1 Problem 3” makes it hard for other members of the class community to know if they’re having a similar issue or if they can help. Since the TA and I may not be checking Ed religiously, you’ll get faster responses if other students feel prepared to help.\nIntroduce the problem. What have you tried? What error message are you getting? Have you been able to identify a specific line of code or section of code that’s causing the problem?\nProvide code. It’s very difficult to get a sense of what might be going wrong if you just say that you have a problem, even if you share the error message. If you have a small question (you can demonstrate the error with a brief snippet of code), you can directly put this into your Ed post, but otherwise, please provide a link to your GitHub repository and where to find the relevant codes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou must commit and push your current files to GitHub prior to this, or we won’t be able to see the code that you’re having trouble with.\n\n\n\nCome to office hours. If you can identify the problem, but we’re having trouble solving it via Ed or more urgency is required, please come to office hours and we can try to work through the issue. This is most helpful if you’ve already done some problem-solving on your own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWaiting until the last day or two to start an assignment can cause problems if you don’t have time to work through the following steps. If office hours are busy and you haven’t gone through the prior steps, you may be prioritized below than students who are have, and we may not have time to solve your problem. Running into coding challenges is not a valid reason to get an extension on an assignment!\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I get a PDF of my notebook for submission?\nThere are two main options, depending on what you’ve already got set up on your computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRemember to “Run All” cells prior to conversion and submission, or else we won’t see your results!\n\n\n\nIf you have a Python installation, you can use a tool called nbconvert to convert to a PDF (if you also have LaTeX installed) or HTML (and then you can use your browser to print to a PDF).\nIf you don’t have a Python installation, within VS Code, you can use IJulia.jl (which will be included in the environments provided with assignments in this class) as follows (enter these commands into the REPL) to open your notebook in your browser:\nusing IJulia\nnotebook()\nThis should open a Jupyter notebook interface in your browser. Navigate to and open the notebook, and once it has completed running, go to File -> Print Preview in the browser menu and Print to PDF.\n\n\n\nHow do I submit my PDF to Gradescope?\nThe instructions for submitting your assignment to Gradescope can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nMake sure that you mark/tag the pages corresponding to each question! Otherwise, we will deduct 10%. If a problem spans multiple pages, tag them all; if a page includes multiple problems, tag it several times."

As engineers, our work touches on many critical aspects of society, and questions of inclusion and social justice cannot be separated from considerations of systems analysis, objective selection, risk analysis, and trade-offs.\nIn all communications and interactions with each other, members of this class community (students and instructors) are expected to be respectful and inclusive. In this spirit, we ask all participants to:\n\nshare their experiences, values, and beliefs;\nbe open to and respectful of the views of others; and\nvalue each other’s opinions and communicate in a respectful manner.\n\nWe all make mistakes in our communications with one another, both when speaking and listening. Be mindful of how spoken or written language might be misunderstood, and be aware that, for a variety of reasons, how others perceive your words and actions may not be exactly how you intended them. At the same time, it is also essential that we be respectful and interpret each other’s comments and actions in good faith.\nPlease let me know if you feel any aspect(s) of class could be made more inclusive. Please also share any preferred name(s) and/or your pronouns with me if you wish: I use he/him/his, and you can refer to me either as Vivek or Prof. Srikrishnan.\n\n\nStudent Accomodations\nLet me know if you have any access barriers in this course, whether they relate to course materials, assignments, or communications. If any special accomodations would help you navigate any barriers and improve your chances of success, please exercise your right to those accomodations and reach out to me as early as possible with your Student Disability Services (SDS) accomodation letter. This will ensure that we have enough time to make appropriate arrangements.\nIf you need more immediate accomodations, but do not yet have a letter, please let me know and then follow up with SDS.\n\n\nCourse Communications\nMost course communications will occur via Ed Discussion. Public Ed posts are generally preferred to private posts or emails, as other students can benefit from the discussions. If you would like to discuss something privately, please do reach out through email or a private Ed post (which will only be viewable by you and the course staff).\nAnnouncements will be made on the course website and in Ed. Emergency announcements will also be made on Canvas.\n\n\nMental Health Resources\nWe all have to take care of our mental health, just as we would our physical health. As a student, you may experience a range of issues which can negatively impact your mental health. Please do not ignore any of these stressors, or feel like you have to navigate these challenges alone! You are part of a community of students, faculty, and staff, who have a responsibility to look for one another’s well-being. If you are struggling with managing your mental health, or if you believe a classmate may be struggling, please reach out to the course instructor, the TA, or, for broader support, please take advantage of Cornell’s mental health resources.\nThe TA and myself are not trained counselors, but we are here to support you in whatever capacity we can. You should never feel that you need to push yourself past your limits to complete any assignment for this class or any other. If we need to make modifications to the course or assignment schedule, you can certainly reach out to us, and all relevant discussions will be kept strictly confidential."

    "section": "Course Policies",
    "text": "Course Policies\n\nAttendance\nAttendance is not required, but in general, students who attend class regularly will do better and get more out of the class than students who do not. Your class participation grade will reflect both the quantity and quality of your participation, only some of which can occur asynchronously. I will put as many course materials, such as lecture notes and announcements, as possible online, but viewing materials online is not the same as active participation and engagement.\nLife happens, of course, and this may lead you to miss class. Let me know if you need any appropriate arrangements ahead of time. For example, please stay home if you’re feeling sick! This is beneficial for both for your own recovery and the health and safety of your classmates. We will also make any necessary arrangements if whatever is going on will negatively impact your grade, for example by causing you to be unable to submit an assignment on time.\n\n\nMask Policies\nMasks are encouraged but not required in the classroom, per university policy. However, the University strongly encourages compliance with requests to mask from students, faculty, and staff who are concerned about the risk of infection. Please be respectful of these concerns and requests if you cannot wear a mask.\nWhile I understand that students often prefer their instructors to be unmasked, I am frequently in contact with people whose underlying health conditions make them higher-risk for severe complications from COVID-19. As a result, I will not personally unmask unless every student in the classroom is wearing their mask properly, to ensure that I can interact with the entire class. Masks will be made available in class if you would like to wear one and do not have one on you.\nI will require masks to be worn in my office or during in-person office hours, as we are necessarily interacting in close quarters without great airflow.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat, copy, or plagiarize!\nThis class is designed to encourage collaboration, and students are encouraged to discuss their work with other students. However, I expect students to abide by the Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity in all aspects of this class. All work submitted must represent the students’ own work and understanding, whether individually or as a group (depending on the particulars of the assignment). This includes analyses, code, software runs, and reports. Engineering as a profession relies upon the honesty and integrity of its practitioners (see e.g. the American Society for Civil Engineers’ Code of Ethics).\n\n\nExternal Resources\nThe collaborative environment in this class should not be viewed as an invitation for plagiarism. Plagiarism occurs when a writer intentionally misrepresents another’s words or ideas (including code!) as their own without acknowledging the source. All external resources which are consulted while working on an assignment should be referenced, including other students and faculty with whom the assignment is discussed. You will never be penalized for consulting an external source for help and referencing it, but plagiarism will result in a zero for that assignment as well as the potential for your case to be passed on for additional disciplinary action.\n\n\nAI/ML Resource Policy\nAs noted, all work submitted for a grade in this course must reflect your own understanding. The use and consulation of AI/ML tools, such as ChatGPT or similar, must be pre-approved and clearly referenced. If approved, you must:\n\nreference the URL of the service you are using including the specific date you accessed it;\nprovide the exact query used to interact with the tool; and\nreport the exact response received.\n\nFailure to attain prior approval or fully reference the interaction, as described above, will be treated as plagiarism and referred to the University accordingly.\n\n\nLate Work Policy\nIn general, late work will be subjected to a 10% penalty per day, which can accumulate to 100% of the total grade. However, sometimes things come up in life. Please reach out ahead of time if you have extenuating circumstances (including University-approved absences or illnesses) which would make it difficult for you to submit your work on time. Work which would be late for appropriate reasons will be given extensions and the late penalty will be waived."

Your notebooks for these exercises should be submitted by the end of the given week, no later than 9:00pm on Friday. These will be graded solely on the basis of completion. Two application exercises will be dropped.\n\n\nLab Notebooks: 15%\nSome classes will involve hands-on exercises (which we will call “labs”) which will give you guided practice applying the concepts and methods from class. These classes will be announced on the course website ahead of time so anyone who is able can bring a laptop to class, and notebooks will be provided on GitHub. These labs can be done in groups; if you cannot bring a laptop to class for whatever reason, you will be able to (and are encouraged to) work with other students, though you must turn in your own notebook for grading.\nSome details on lab logistics:\n\nSome of the labs may some time outside of class, but they will not be as intensive as a homework assignment.\nYou will be required to submit a PDF of your completed notebook to Gradescope by 9:00pm one week after the lab session. Tag the answers to each question: points will be deducted if this is not done.\nWhile your lowest lab grade will not be dropped, late penalties will be waived for appropriate reasons discussed with the instructor (ideally ahead of time when circumstances allow).\nRubrics will be provided for lab grading as part of the lab assignments.\n\n\n\nHomework Assignments: 40%\nApproximately 5-6 homework assignments will be assigned throughout the semester; the specifics depend on how quickly we move through the material. You will typically have 10 days to 2 weeks to work on Students are encouraged to collaborate and learn from each other on homework assignments, but each student must submit their own solutions reflecting their understanding of the material. Consulting and referencing external resources and your peers is encouraged (engineering is a collaborative discipline!), but plagiarism is a violation of academic integrity.\nSome notes on assignment and grading logistics:\n\nHomework assignments will be distributed using GitHub Classroom. Students should make sure they update their GitHub repositories as they work on the assignments; this helps with answering questions and gives you a backstop in case something goes wrong and you can’t submit your assignment on time.\nHomeworks are due by 9:00pm Eastern Time on the designed due date. Your assignment notebook (which include your writeup and codes) should be submitted to Gradescope as a PDF with the answers to each question tagged (a failure to do this will result in deductions).\nRubrics will be provided for the homeworks as part of the assignments.s\nYour lowest homework grade will be dropped. We can discuss arrangements if multiple assignments will be missed for university-approved reasons, preferably ahead of time.\nRegrade requests for specific problems must be made within a week of the grading of that assignment. However, note that regrades can cut both ways: the TA can take away points as well!\n\n\n\nFinal Term Project: 40%\nThis course will culminate with a term project with a topic selected from a suggested list (provided mid-semester). The goal of this project is to apply and extend the tools and approaches we will learn in class. While we encourage drawing on other classes or interests when developing and working on your project, submitting work from another course or work which was completed prior to the course is not permitted.\nThe term project will be completed in small groups (2-3 students) for students enrolled in BEE 4750 and individually for those in BEE 5750. The final deliverable for this project will be a poster summarizing the project and results. Ahead of that, you will submit the following:\n\na proposal for feedback on the scope of your project; and\na 2-3 page report on the status and history of a regulation of interest relevant to the system you are studying.\n\nRubrics will be provided for the components of the project."

    "section": "Data Types",
    "text": "Data Types\nEach datum (importantly, not the variable which is bound to it) has a data type. Julia types are similar to C types, in that they require not only the type of data (Int, Float, String, etc), but also the precision (which is related to the amount of memory allocated to the variable). Issues with precision won’t be a big deal in this class, though they matter when you’re concerned about performance vs. decimal accuracy of code.\nYou can identify the type of a variable or expression with the typeof() function.\n\ntypeof(\"This is a string.\")\n\nString\n\n\n\ntypeof(x)\n\nInt64\n\n\n\nNumeric types\nA key distinction is between an integer type (or Int) and a floating-point number type (or float). Integers only hold whole numbers, while floating-point numbers correspond to numbers with fractional (or decimal) parts. For example, 9 is an integer, while 9.25 is a floating point number. The difference between the two has to do with the way the number is stored in memory. 9, an integer, is handled differently in memory than 9.0, which is a floating-point number, even though they’re mathematically the same value.\n\ntypeof(9)\n\nInt64\n\n\n\ntypeof(9.25)\n\nFloat64\n\n\nSometimes certain function specifications will require you to use a Float variable instead of an Int. One way to force an Int variable to be a Float is to add a decimal point at the end of the integer.\n\ntypeof(9.)\n\nFloat64\n\n\n\n\nStrings\nStrings hold characters, rather than numeric values. Even if a string contains what seems like a number, it is actually stored as the character representation of the digits. As a result, you cannot use arithmetic operators (for example) on this datum.\n\n\"5\" + 5\n\nLoadError: MethodError: no method matching +(::String, ::Int64)\n\u001b[0mClosest candidates are:\n\u001b[0m  +(::Any, ::Any, \u001b[91m::Any\u001b[39m, \u001b[91m::Any...\u001b[39m) at operators.jl:591\n\u001b[0m  +(\u001b[91m::T\u001b[39m, ::T) where T<:Union{Int128, Int16, Int32, Int64, Int8, UInt128, UInt16, UInt32, UInt64, UInt8} at int.jl:87\n\u001b[0m  +(\u001b[91m::T\u001b[39m, ::Integer) where T<:AbstractChar at char.jl:237\n\u001b[0m  ...\n\n\nHowever, you can try to tell Julia to interpret a string encoding a numeric character as a numeric value using the parse() function. This can also be used to encode a numeric data as a string.\n\nparse(Int64, \"5\") + 5\n\n10\n\n\nTwo strings can be concatenated using *:\n\n\"Hello\" * \" \" * \"there\"\n\n\"Hello there\"\n\n\n\n\nBooleans\nBoolean variables (or Bools) are logical variables, that can have true or false as values.\n\nb = true\n\ntrue\n\n\nNumerical comparisons, such as ==, !=, or <, return a Bool.\n\nc = 9 > 11\n\nfalse\n\n\nBools are important for logical flows, such as if-then-else blocks or certain types of loops."

    "section": "Functions",
    "text": "Functions\nA function is an object which accepts a tuple of arguments and maps them to a return value. In Julia, functions are defined using the following syntax.\n\nfunction my_actual_function(x, y)\n    return x + y\nend\nmy_actual_function(3, 5)\n\n8\n\n\nFunctions in Julia do not require explicit use of a return statement. They will return the last expression evaluated in their definition. However, it’s good style to explicitly return function outputs. This improves readability and debugging, especially when functions can return multiple expressions based on logical control flows (if-then-else blocks).\nFunctions in Julia are objects, and can be treated like other objects. They can be assigned to new variables or passed as arguments to other functions.\n\ng = my_actual_function\ng(3, 5)\n\n8\n\n\n\nfunction function_of_functions(f, x, y)\n    return f(x, y)\nend\nfunction_of_functions(g, 3, 5)\n\n8\n\n\n\nShort and Anonymous Functions\nIn addition to the long form of the function definition shown above, simple functions can be specified in more compact forms when helpful.\nThis is the short form:\n\nh₁(x) = x^2 # make the subscript using \\_1 + <TAB>\nh₁(4)\n\n16\n\n\nThis is the anonymous form:\n\nx->sin(x)\n(x->sin(x))(π/4)\n\n0.7071067811865475\n\n\n\n\nMutating Functions\nThe convention in Julia is that functions should not modify (or mutate) their input data. The reason for this is to ensure that the data is preserved. Mutating functions are mainly appropriate for applications where performance needs to be optimized, and making a copy of the input data would be too memory-intensive.\nIf you do write a mutating function in Julia, the convention is to add a ! to its name, like my_mutating_function!(x).\n\n\nOptional arguments\nThere are two extremes with regard to function parameters which do not always need to be changed. The first is to hard-code them into the function body, which has a clear downside: when you do want to change them, the function needs to be edited directly. The other extreme is to treat them as regular arguments, passing them every time the function is called. This has the downside of potentially creating bloated function calls, particularly when there is a standard default value that makes sense for most function evaluations.\nMost modern languages, including Julia, allow an alternate solution, which is to make these arguments optional. This involves setting a default value, which is used unless the argument is explicitly defined in a function call.\n\nfunction setting_optional_arguments(x, y, c=0.5)\n    return c * (x + y)\nend\n\nsetting_optional_arguments (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nIf we want to stick with the fixed value \\(c=0.5\\), all we have to do is call setting_optional_arguments with the x and y arguments.\n\nsetting_optional_arguments(3, 5)\n\n4.0\n\n\nOtherwise, we can pass a new value for c.\n\nsetting_optional_arguments(3, 5, 2)\n\n16\n\n\n\n\nPassing data structures as arguments\nInstead of passing variables individually, it may make sense to pass a data structure, such as an array or a tuple, and then unpacking within the function definition. This is straightforward in long form: access the appropriate elements using their index.\nIn short or anonymous form, there is a trick which allows the use of readable variables within the function definition.\n\nh₂((x,y)) = x*y # enclose the input arguments in parentheses to tell Julia to expect and unpack a tuple\n\nh₂ (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\nh₂((2, 3)) # this works perfectly, as we passed in a tuple\n\n6\n\n\n\nh₂(2, 3) # this gives an error, as h₂ expects a single tuple, not two different numeric values\n\nLoadError: MethodError: no method matching h₂(::Int64, ::Int64)\n\u001b[0mClosest candidates are:\n\u001b[0m  h₂(::Any) at In[50]:1\n\n\n\nh₂([3, 10]) # this also works with arrays instead of tuples\n\n30\n\n\n\n\nVectorized operations\nJulia uses dot syntax to vectorize an operation and apply it element-wise across an array.\nFor example, to calculate the square root of 3:\n\nsqrt(3)\n\n1.7320508075688772\n\n\nTo calculate the square roots of every integer between 1 and 5:\n\nsqrt.([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\n5-element Vector{Float64}:\n 1.0\n 1.4142135623730951\n 1.7320508075688772\n 2.0\n 2.23606797749979\n\n\nThe same dot syntax is used for arithmetic operations over arrays, since these operations are really functions.\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4] .* 2\n\n4-element Vector{Int64}:\n 2\n 4\n 6\n 8\n\n\nVectorization can be faster and is more concise to write and read than applying the same function to multiple variables or objects explicitly, so take advantage!\n\n\nReturning multiple values\nYou can return multiple values by separating them with a comma. This implicitly causes the function to return a tuple of values.\n\nfunction return_multiple_values(x, y)\n    return x + y, x * y\nend\nreturn_multiple_values(3, 5)\n\n(8, 15)\n\n\nThese values can be unpacked into multiple variables.\n\nn, ν = return_multiple_values(3, 5)\nn\n\n8\n\n\n\nν\n\n15\n\n\n\n\nReturning nothing\nSometimes you don’t want a function to return any values at all. For example, you might want a function that only prints a string to the console.\n\nfunction print_some_string(x)\n    println(\"x: $x\")\n    return nothing\nend\nprint_some_string(42)\n\nx: 42"

For example, if we wanted to compute the absolute value of a number, rather than using abs():\n\nfunction our_abs(x)\n    if x >= 0\n        return x\n    else\n        return -x\n    end\nend\n\nour_abs (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\nour_abs(4)\n\n4\n\n\n\nour_abs(-4)\n\n4\n\n\nTo nest conditional statements, use elseif.\n\nfunction test_sign(x)\n    if x > 0\n        return Text(\"x is positive.\")\n    elseif x < 0\n        return Text(\"x is negative.\")\n    else\n        return Text(\"x is zero.\")\n    end\nend\n\ntest_sign (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\ntest_sign(-5)\n\nx is negative.\n\n\n\ntest_sign(0)\n\nx is zero.\n\n\n\n\nLoops\nLoops allow expressions to be evaluated repeatedly until they are terminated. The two main types of loops are while loops and for loops.\n\nWhile loops\nwhile loops continue to evaluate an expression so long as a specified boolean condition is true. This is useful when you don’t know how many iterations it will take for the desired goal to be reached.\n\nfunction compute_factorial(x)\n    factorial = 1\n    while (x > 1)\n        factorial *= x\n        x -= 1\n    end\n    return factorial\nend\ncompute_factorial(5)\n\n120\n\n\n\nWhile loops can easily turn into infinite loops if the condition is never meaningfully updated. Be careful, and look there if your programs are getting stuck. Also, If the expression in a while loop is false when the loop is reached, the loop will never be evaluated.\n\n\n\nFor loops\nfor loops run for a finite number of iterations, based on some defined index variable.\n\nfunction add_some_numbers(x)\n    total_sum = 0 # initialize at zero since we're adding\n    for i=1:x # the counter i is updated every iteration\n        total_sum += i\n    end\n    return total_sum\nend\nadd_some_numbers(4)\n\n10\n\n\nfor loops can also iterate over explicitly passed containers, rather than iterating over an incrementally-updated index sequence. Use the in keyword when defining the loop.\n\nfunction add_passed_numbers(set)\n    total_sum = 0\n    for i in set # this is the syntax we use when we want i to correspond to different container values\n        total_sum += i\n    end\n    return total_sum\nend\nadd_passed_numbers([1, 3, 5])\n\n9"

You will also need to select a solver and install the relevant package. Some of these are commercial, while others are open source. Solvers are also not typically universal, as different types of optimization problems use different algorithms, so be aware of what problem you’re trying to solve instead of just blindly copying code from one task to another.\nFor example, for the linear programming example, we will use the Clp (COIN-OR Linear Programming) solver via the Clp package. As seen on the solver table, Clp is open source (via the EPL, or Eclipse Public License) and can solve linear programs (LP). For the mixed-integer linear programming example, we will instead of the Cbc (COIN-OR Branch and Cut) solver via the Cbc package. This is also open-source (it comes from the same group as Clp) and can solve mixed-integer or binary linear programs."

    "text": "Linear Programming Example: How Many Widgets Should A Factory Produce?\n\nDefining The Problem\nSuppose we own a factory that can produce two types of widgets:\n\nWidget A generates a profit of \\(p_A = \\$100\\) per widget; and\nWidget B generates a profit of \\(p_B = \\$75\\) per widget. Let \\(x\\) be the number of units of widget A that we want to produce, and \\(y\\) the number of units of widget B. Our goal is to maximize our total profit \\(p_Ax + p_By\\). This is the objective function. We express this objective using the equation \\[\\max 100x + 75y.\\]\n\nFurther, we cannot build a negative number of either type of widget. This is known as a non-negativity constraint, and can be expressed as \\[\\begin{align}\nx &\\geq 0\\\\\ny &\\geq 0\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis isn’t a very interesting problem yet! We would simply build as much of both widgets as we could, because there are no constraints on our ability to produce. To make this more realistic, let’s suppose that both widgets are produced using the same raw material \\(M\\), of which we can only procure 300 units. Then, if:\n\nWidget A requires 40 units of \\(M\\) per widget, and\nWidget B requires 20 units of \\(M\\) per widget, we arrive at the following material constraint: \\[40x + 20y \\leq 300.\\]\n\nBut we might have another constraint: time! Each widget may take a different amount of labor to produce. For example, let’s say that\n\nWidget A takes 6 hours to produce and\nWidget B takes 12 hours to produce. Further, there are only 80 hours per work that can be allocated to widget production. This becomes the time constraint \\[6x + 12y \\leq 80.\\]\n\nConsolidating equations (1)–(4) gives us the following constrained optimization problem: \\[\\begin{align}\n& &\\max 100x + 75y\\\\\n&\\text{subject to} & \\\\\n& & x \\geq 0\\\\\n& & y \\geq 0 \\\\\n& & 40x + 20y \\leq 300\\\\\n& & 6x + 12y \\leq 80\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nVisualizing the Problem\nLet’s do some plotting to examine the geometry of our optimization problem. We can do this using the Plots package in Julia.\n\n# set up objective function parameters and variables\npa = 100\npb = 75\na = range(0, 8, step=0.25)\nb = range(0, 8, step=0.25)\n\n# define objective function\nf(a, b) = pa * a + pb * b\n\nf (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\n# start plotting\nusing Plots\nplotlyjs()\n\ncontour(a,b,(a,b)->f(a,b),nlevels=15, c=:heat, linewidth=10, colorbar = false, contour_labels = true) # objective function contours\ntitle!(\"Factory Optimization Problem\") # add title\nxaxis!(\"x=Widget A\", lims=(0, maximum(a))) # add x-axis title and limits\nyaxis!(\"y=Widget B\", lims=(0, maximum(b))) # add y-axis title and limits\nxticks!(0:maximum(a)) # set x-axis ticks\nyticks!(0:maximum(b)) # set y-axis ticks\nareaplot!(a[a.<=11], (300 .- 40*a)./20, legend=false, opacity=0.3) # plot materials constraint feasible region\nareaplot!(a[a.<=8], (80 .- 6*a)./12, legend=false, opacity=0.3) # plot time constraint feasible region\n\n\nThe WebIO Jupyter extension was not detected. See the\n\n    WebIO Jupyter integration documentation\n\nfor more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see exactly where the solution will be, at the intersection of the feasible regions imposed by the two constraints (note how this is related to the gradient of the objective function)! Let’s now use JuMP to identify the location of this point (though we could also solve for it using linear algebra).\n\n\nSolving This Problem Using JuMP\n\nSetting Up the Model and Solver\nFirst, we should load JuMP and Clp.\n\nusing JuMP\nusing Clp\n\nTo solve our problem, first we need to define the model. The model object has lots of attributes, including the variables, constraints, solver options, etc. We create a new model using the Model() function. Since we are using the Clp solver, we need to tell JuMP to use the Clp.Optimizer solver function.\n\nfactory_model = Model(Clp.Optimizer)\n\nA JuMP Model\nFeasibility problem with:\nVariables: 0\nModel mode: AUTOMATIC\nCachingOptimizer state: EMPTY_OPTIMIZER\nSolver name: Clp\n\n\nThere are a bunch of attributes and options that we could set, but we won’t in this example. If needed, look at the Clp.jl documentation.\n\n\nDefine Variables\nDecision variables (\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in this case) in JuMP are defined using the @variable macro. The first argument passed to @variable() is the model object, in this case, factory_model, and the second argument are bounds on that variable, created using >= and <=. JuMP will interpret the bound specification to obtain the variable name. In this case, our only bounds directly on the variables are the non-negativity constraints.\n\n@variable(factory_model, x >= 0);\n\n\n@variable(factory_model, y >= 0);\n\nIf we had a free (or unbounded) variable \\(z\\), we could declare that variable using @variable(model, z). JuMP also requires unique names for each variable, or it will throw an error. This is one place where it’s nice that Julia lets us use sub- and superscripts in variable names!\nIf we did want to modify the bounds after defining the variable, we could do so using the set_lower_bound and set_upper_bound functions, or we could remove them using delete_lower_bound and delete_upper_bound.\nFinally, if we want to see all of the variables associated with a model, we can use the all_variables function to obtain an array.\n\nall_variables(factory_model)\n\n2-element Vector{VariableRef}:\n x\n y\n\n\n\n\nDefine Constraints\nWhen defining variables, we were able to declare constraints on their values by specifying upper and lower bounds. However, we also have other constraints, which involve multiple decision variables. These are specified using the @constraint macro. Unlike variables, we also need to pass names for each constraint. We will use time for the time constraint and materials for the materials constraint. These names must be unique.\n\n@constraint(factory_model, time, 6x + 12y <= 80) # specify the time constraint\n\ntime : 6 x + 12 y ≤ 80.0\n\n\n\n@constraint(factory_model, materials, 40x + 20y <= 300) # materials constraint\n\nmaterials : 40 x + 20 y ≤ 300.0\n\n\n\n\nDefine Objective Function\nSo far, we’ve defined the feasible region of the decision-variable domain by setting the constraints. But we need to specify our objective function to know what we are trying to minimize or maximize over this region. We define the objective function using the @objective macro. In addition to specifying the model objective and the function, we need to tell JuMP whether we want to minimize or maximize.\n\n@objective(factory_model, Max, 100x + 75y)\n\n\\[ 100 x + 75 y \\]\n\n\nNow, let’s look at the model specification.\n\nprint(factory_model)\n\n\\[ \\begin{aligned}\n\\max\\quad & 100 x + 75 y\\\\\n\\text{Subject to} \\quad & 6 x + 12 y \\leq 80.0\\\\\n& 40 x + 20 y \\leq 300.0\\\\\n& x \\geq 0.0\\\\\n& y \\geq 0.0\\\\\n\\end{aligned} \\]\n\n\nWe can also get a nicely styled LaTeX version, which might be useful.\n\nlatex_formulation(factory_model)\n\n\\[ \\begin{aligned}\n\\max\\quad & 100 x + 75 y\\\\\n\\text{Subject to} \\quad & 6 x + 12 y \\leq 80.0\\\\\n& 40 x + 20 y \\leq 300.0\\\\\n& x \\geq 0.0\\\\\n& y \\geq 0.0\\\\\n\\end{aligned} \\]\n\n\nWe won’t go into detail here, but there are other ways to define the model, which are detailed in the JuMP documentation. For example, we can specify multiple variables using @variables. Similarly, we can use @constraints to define multiple constraints at once. Or we can use loops to define multiple constraints or constraints involving many variables. We can also specify the model in vectorized syntax, which is similar to how linear programs are specified in MATLAB.\n\n\nSolve the Model\nNow it’s time to solve the model and find the optimal values \\((x^*, y^*)\\). Since we specified the solver when we initialized factory_model, all we have to do is call the optimize! function.\n\noptimize!(factory_model)\n\nCoin0506I Presolve 2 (0) rows, 2 (0) columns and 4 (0) elements\nClp0006I 0  Obj 0 Dual inf 175 (2)\nClp0006I 2  Obj 847.22222\nClp0000I Optimal - objective value 847.22222\nClp0032I Optimal objective 847.2222222 - 2 iterations time 0.002\n\n\n\n\nQuery the Solution\nTo find the optimal values of our decision variables, we need to query the values of the variables using value.(). We use value.() (the vectorized version of value()) because JuMP stores decision variables differently depending on their number and how they were defined. Uses the dot-syntax here works with any model specification, while the plain value() will not work if a queried decision variable is stored as a vector.\n\nvalue.(x)\n\n5.555555555555555\n\n\n\nvalue.(y)\n\n3.8888888888888884\n\n\nSo we can see that our optimal inputs are \\[(x^*, y^*) = (5.56, 3.89)\\] (and we’ll pretend that we can manufacture and sell parts of widgets).\n\n\nVisualize the Solution\nLet’s take our previous plot and add the solution point to make sure that we got the solution we expected.\n\n# replot the previous plot\ncontour(a,b,(a,b)->f(a,b),nlevels=15, c=:heat, linewidth=10, colorbar = false, contour_labels = true) # objective function contours\ntitle!(\"Factory Optimization Problem\") # add title\nxaxis!(\"x=Widget A\", lims=(0, maximum(a))) # add x-axis title and limits\nyaxis!(\"y=Widget B\", lims=(0, maximum(b))) # add y-axis title and limits\nxticks!(0:maximum(a)) # set x-axis ticks\nyticks!(0:maximum(b)) # set y-axis ticks\nareaplot!(a, (300 .- 40*a)./20, legend=false, opacity=0.3) # plot materials constraint feasible region\nareaplot!(a, (80 .- 6*a)./12, legend=false, opacity=0.3) # plot time constraint feasible region\n\n# now we plot the solution that we obtained\nscatter!([value.(x)],[value.(y)], markercolor=\"blue\")\n\n\n\n\nThe solution \\[(x^*, y^*)\\] is exactly where we deduced it would be geometrically.\n\n\nOther Stuff We Can Do\nWe can also use value.() to evaluate our constraints without manually using the equations.\n\nvalue.(time)\n\n80.0\n\n\n\nvalue.(materials)\n\n300.0\n\n\nWhat if we also want the optimal objective value? We can obtain this using objective_value().\n\nobjective_value(factory_model)\n\n847.2222222222222\n\n\nWe could also define other expressions via the @expression macro as functions of the decision variables and evaluate those. For example, let’s say that we wanted to know the total number of widgets we’d produce under our optimal allocation of resources.\n\n@expression(factory_model, total_widgets, x+y)\n\n\\[ x + y \\]\n\n\n\nvalue.(total_widgets)\n\n9.444444444444443\n\n\n\n\nDual Solutions\nWe can identify if our model has a dual solution by calling has_duals().\n\nhas_duals(factory_model)\n\ntrue\n\n\nIf we want to know the dual solution associated with a constraint, we use the shadow_price() function.\n\nshadow_price(time)\n\n2.7777777777777786\n\n\n\nshadow_price(materials)\n\n2.083333333333333\n\n\nIf the binding constraint was a variable bound, we could also query that shadow price by calling reduced_cost() on the variable.\nreduced_cost(x)\n\nreduced_cost(y)\n\n-0.0\n\n\nIn this case, the relevant shadow prices are zero because the optimum is in the interior of the domain. If we had added a strong enough upper bound on the value(s) of one or both of our decision variables (say, x <= 4), then this would be non-zero."

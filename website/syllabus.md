## Course Outcomes

At the completion of this class, students will:
1. apply principles of engineering, science, and mathematics to make appropriate assumptions and define a model of an environmental system;
2. use simulation using computer models to draw appropriate conclusions about system dynamics;
3. identify and research regulations applicable to an environmental system and incorporate those regulatory standards in problem-solving;
4. formulate and solve optimization problems with and without uncertainty;
5. analyze risks associated with the management of uncertain environmental systems;
6. assess conflicts and tensions between environmental systems management objectives;
7. demonstrate the ability to acquire and apply new knowledge for solving complex engineering problems.

### Ethical Behavior Statement

This  is  a  collaborative  class  and  while  students  are  expected  to  work  independently,  consultation  is  highly 
encouraged. Specifically, students can and should discuss their work with other students, but must be responsible 
for  their  own  submissions  including  analyses,  code,  software  runs,  and  reports,  unless  otherwise  instructed  (for 
example, during group projects). Cornellâ€™s Policies on Academic Integrity apply to all aspects of this class. 
Please review the Cornell University statement on Academic Integrity here: <http://cuinfo.cornell.edu/aic.cfm>.

### Inclusion

We are committed to serving students from different backgrounds and with any and all identities in a respectful and inclusive manner. If you feel that your learning experience is being negatively impacted by the class or work atmosphere, please do not hesitate to reach out and share your concerns. Similarly, please communicate with us if any other life circumstances are complicating your ability to succeed in the class, and we will make any appropriate arrangements.

### Students With Disabilities

Please reach out to Prof. Srikrishnan as early as possible to provide your Student Disability Services (SDS) accomodation letter to ensure that your approved academic accomodations can be arranged. If you need immediate accomodations, please contact Prof. Srikrishnan as needed. If additional accomodations are needed during the semester, please contact SDS.

        "Julia is an up-and-coming language, originally developed for scientific programming. While learning a new programming language always has its hiccups, the good news is that if you've programmed in a high-level language such as Python or MATLAB, most Julia concepts should look familiar. This notebook will guide you through the basics of writing Julia code and where to look for help. It was adapted from materials by Patrick Applegate and Klaus Keller ([Risk Analysis in the Earth Sciences](https://leanpub.com/raes)), [Tony Wong](https://tonyewong.github.io/), and [Antonia Hadjimichael](https://www.hadjimichael.info/).\n",

You should have set this up as part of [Application Exercise 1](ae/ae-01-setup.html), but if not, do so now and/or ask for help.\n",

        "\n",
        "Jupyter notebooks integrate text and equations in Markdown with Julia (or Python, or R) code. To do this, Jupyter notebooks consist of two types of \"cells\": code cells and Markdown (text) cells.\n",

Text written in Markdown can also include hyperlinks, LaTeX equations, section headers, and images, among other features (most of [the course website](https://viveks.me/climate-risk-analysis) and the lecture notes were all written in Markdown!).

        "- Backticks (`` `...` ``) can be used to format and highlight code, keystrokes, etc.\n",
        "- The `#` sign is used to create a new section header; two `#` signs (`##`) is used to create a new subsection header; `###` creates a subsubsection, and so on.\n",
        "- You can create a bulleted list by using the asterisk `*` or a dash `-` and a space.\n",
        "- You can create regular text by just typing as usual.\n",
        "- You can create **bold-faced text** by wrapping it with two asterisks on both sides.\n",
        "- You can create *italicized text* by wrapping it with a single asterisk on both sides.\n",
        "- To create a new paragraph, you must include a blank line between the old and new paragraphs.\n",
        "\n",
        "At this point you might be wondering how to turn this cell back into the fully formatted Markdown text instead of the raw Markdown you're probably still looking at. You have a couple of options, depending on your platform, but the most consistent is to type `Shift + Enter` to **execute** the cell (this is also how to run code, but more on that later).\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, you will frequently need to create new cells in your Jupyter notebooks. How you do this will depend on how you interact with the notebook, but try to figure this out now.\n",
        "\n",
        "One tip is to think carefully about what bits of code should be in the same cell, as you typically only see output from the last command in a cell. For example, compare the following:\n"

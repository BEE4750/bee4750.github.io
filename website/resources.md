## Julia Programming

* [QuantEcon MATLAB-Python-Julia cheatsheet](https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/)
* [FastTrack to Julia cheatsheet](https://juliadocs.github.io/Julia-Cheat-Sheet/)
* [Plotting cheatsheet](https://github.com/sswatson/cheatsheets/blob/master/plotsjl-cheatsheet.pdf)
* [Introduction to Computational Thinking](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/): a great Julia based course at MIT!

## Optimization and Decision-Making

* [Decision Modeling e-Book](https://linney.mun.ca/pages/view.php?ref=36808): this uses Excel Solver, but may have useful information on problem setup and optimization methods.
* [Algorithms for Decision-Making](https://algorithmsbook.com/): open-access book based on Julia with more depth on optimization and decision-making algorithms than we will cover in this class.

# Lecture Schedule
@@

The following table gives a schedule of topics we will cover in lecture, as well as when homeworks are assigned. Tutorials and code examples which are relevant to the lecture topic will also be linked. This table will be updated as necessary, as some discussions may take more or less time than anticipated.

Links to readings from peer-reviewed literature may require a Cornell login for access.

To save the lecture slides as a pdf, print the HTML to a PDF using your browser.

Please make sure that your class exercise repository is updated ahead of classes when we will be doing in-class coding exercises.
